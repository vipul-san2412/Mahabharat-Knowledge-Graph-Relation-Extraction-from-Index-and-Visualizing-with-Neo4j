they did all things under the advice of the old king kunti obeyed gaandhuri draupadi and subhadraa, etc showed the utmost respect for the old king and his queen the paandavas surrounded the old king and his queen with every luxury, and maireya wines, etc. kripa waited upon dhrita raashtra vyaasa frequently visited him and recited histories of old ri celestial ascetics, p and raa. vidura, under

yudhishthira nobody dared to speak evil of duryodhana or dhritaraashtra. bhima, however, reverenced the old king outwardly, with a very unwilling heart . while there was no variance in the cordiality between yudhishthira and dhritaraashtra, the latter could not but feel unfriendly towards bhima, and bhima, recollecting his foes duryodhana, karna, and dushaasana, indulged in boastful language about duryodhana and his brothers whom he had slain. gaandhaari was not moved. after years dhritaraashtra, afflicted by the wordy darts of bhima, became penetrated with despair and grief yudhishthira, etc did not know it. dhritaraashtra opened his heart to his friends now he was observing a vow of fast, which he had concealed from yudhishthira, lying on the earth clad in deerskin gaandhaari observed similar vows now he asked yudhishthiras permission for himself and gaandhaari to retire into the woods clad in rags and bark in order to practise austerities. yudhishthira lamented but dhritaraashtras resolution remains unaltered he asked sanjaya and kripa to speak for him to yudhishthira leaning on gaandhaari he looked like one deprived of life yudhishthira lamented, and gently rubbed dhritaraashtras breast and face with cold water and revived him by the touch of his hand, on which were jewels and medicinal herbs. dhritaraashtra said that the touch of yudhishthira was highly gratifying, embraced him, and smelt his head vidura, kunti, etc wept gaandhaari bore her sorrow with fortitude. dhrita raashtra renewed his request vyaasa came and asked yudhishthira to permit dhritaraashtra to follow the path of all the ancient r. ri. gaandhaari bears her grief with fortitude. yudhishthira yielded to vyaasas intercession vyaasa summed ap the reasons for dhritaraashtras retirement, and then proceeded to the woods. yudhishthira then said that he would conform to the advice of vyaasa, etc. dhritaraashtra, gaandhaari, etc entering the palace of dhritaraashtra, ate a little. then dhritaraashtra gave yudhish thira advice about how the latter should rule his king . continuation . continuation agreeably to the science known to ushanas, shakata, padma, and vajra should be formed thou hast been instructed in all duties by bhishma, krishna, and vidura horse sacrifices and righteous rule are productive of equal merit . yudhishthira gratefully accepted his instruc tions, as bhishma, etc no longer were there to instruct him. dhritaraashtra wishes to depart soon, and gaandhaari reminded him that he has got the permission of vyaasa, and asks him when he would go to the forest with the permission of yudhishthira he wished first to make gifts for the advance ment in the other world of his dead sons and other kinsmen, and assembled all the subjects, while yudhishthira brought all the articles necessary dhritaraashtra, in a touching address, took leave of that large concourse of men of all the four castes, recapitulating the history of the realm from shaantanu nwards . the citizens were exceedingly agitated upon hearing dhrita raashtras address they charged the learned brahman shaamba with answering him king duryodhana never did us any wrong we were well protected and ruled by him we have also enjoyed great happiness for thousands of years under yudhishthira, who follows the conduct of the r. ri. of old the carnage on the field of kurukshetra was not brought about by duryo dhana, karna, and shakuni, nor by dhritaraashtra, but by destiny, which in days caused akshauhinis to be destroyed by bhishma, etc. the paandavas are capable of ruling without either thee or ourselves to look after them kunti, etc will not the least wrong to the people. then dhritaraashtra slowly dismissed the assembly, and entered his house with gaandhaari . after that night had passed away, dhritaraashtra sent vidura to yudhishthira in order to announce that he would set out for the woods on the coming day of the full moon in the month of kaarttika, and to solicit some wealth for performing the shraaddha of bhishma, etc. . yudhishthira and arjuna applauded his words bhima was unwilling, recollecting duryodhana arjuna sought to pacify him, applauded by yudhishthira bhimasena maintained that gifts for bhishma, etc should be given by them, and by kunti for karna let duryodhana, etc sink from a miserable to a more miserable position, reminding his brothers of the woes and disgrace inflicted upon them by those for whose benefit dhritaraashtra asked for wealth . yudhish thira rebuked him . arjuna urged bhima to forget the injuries. yudhishthira said to vidura that he would give dhritaraashtra so much wealth as he wished for the obsequies of his sons and bhishma, etc and asked him to tell dhrita raashtra not to be angry with bhimasena . vidura reported the speeches of yudhishthira, arjuna, and bhima to dhritaraashtra. dhritaraashtra expressed his satisfaction, and set his heart on making large presents on the day of full moon in the month of kaarttika . dhritaraashtra invited thousands of deserving brahmans superior ri. for bhishma, etc. and made large gifts to them, naming drona, etc. tellers and scribes appointed by yudhishthira ceaselessly ask the old king as to what should be given to each recipient that presented himself unto him that was to receive a were given, and he who was to receive was presented with, at the command of yudhishthira this was given by dhritaraashtra for the benefit in the other world of his sons and grandsons, as also of himself and gaandhaari the ation lasted for days . on the day of full moon in the month of kaarttika dhritaraashtra summoned the paandavas, caused the rites to be performed, and his sacred fire to be taken up, put on deerskins and bark, and set out with his daughters in law. the ladies uttered loud wails yudhishthira and arjuna were pierced with grief bhimasena, etc all followed dhritaraashtra kunti held on her shoulders the hand of gaandhaari, who walked with her bandaged eyes dhritaraashtra walked behind gaandhaari, placing his hand on her shoulder krishnaa, etc all proceeded with dhrita raashtra the citizens of all orders were as distressed as they had been at the departure of the paandavas after the match of dice dhritaraashtra left the city through the principal gate, and then asked those who followed him to desist. vidura and sanjaya retired with him into the woods kripa and yuyutsu he caused to remain, and made them over to yudhishthira. kunti retired with dhritaraashtra, though yudhishthira sought to dissuade her she said never show any disregard for sahadeva he is very much attached to me, and to thee also then she reminded him of karna, etc. yudhishthira reminded her that she had herself formerly recited to them the story of vidulaa, when they were about to set out from the town, and that they had won sovereignty guided by her words com municated through krishna. also bhima dissuaded her, pointing out the grief of the sons of maadri but in vain. draupadi and subhadraa followed her, and so did the paandavas with all their wives and attendants kunti addressed them, assigning her reasons for her conduct . the paandavas and draupadi then desisted from following her. the paandavas circumambulated dhrita raashtra, etc for taking their leave to return. dhritaraashtra made a final effort of dis suading kunti from retiring into the forest with him, but in vain. the ladies set up a loud wail of grief. haastinapura became plunged into sorrow no festivals were observed. the paandavas were without any energy. dhritaraashtra arrived on the banks of the bhaagirathi and took rest there for the night among the brahmans, who there, like himself, ignited their sacred fires arrangement of the beds of vidura, etc. the yaajaka brahmans, etc of the king laid themselves n on their respective beds that night seemed as delightful to them as a braahmi night. when the night had passed away dhritaraashtra, etc going through their morning acts and rites, continue their journey . following the advice of vidura, dhritaraashtra took up his abode on the banks of the bhaagirathi many of the four orders came to see him he gladdened them all by his words. at evening dhritaraashtra, etc bathed in the stream, etc. kunti led him and gaandhaari. then he proceeded to kurukshetra to the retreat of r. ri. shatayupa, who received him with due rites accompanied by him he proceeded to the retreat of vyaasa, where he received the initiation after having returned he took up his abode in the retreat of shatayupa, who instructed him in all the rites of the forest mode of life, at the command of vyaasa. dhrita raashtra, etc began to practise austerities . ri. naarada, etc came there and gladdened dhritaraashtra with discourses on religion. ri. naarada mentioned the kings that attained to heaven after practising penances in that very retreat sahasracitya, shailaalaya, prishadhra, purukutsa, shashaloman thou also wilt, with gaandhaari, through the grace of vyaasa, attain to a very high goal dwelling in the presence of indra, paandu always thinks of thee, and will assist thee in the attainment of prosperity

heaven. dhritaraashtra, etc praised naarada. shatayupa asked naarada what regions will be acquired by dhritaraashtra. naarada said on a visit to indra saw paandu indra said that after three years dhritaraashtra and gaandhaari would go to the abode of kubera, on a car moving at will, and he would rove through the regions of g and raa. this is a mystery of the gods. all the persons present became highly pleased. then they went away by the path of the siddhas . the anxiety of the paandavas and citizens about the fate of dhrita raashtra, etc and their despair when they reflected on that terrible slaughter of their kinsmen only parikshit somehow consoled them afflicted with grief, they failed to derive pleasure from anything, nor did they attend to their kingly offices, thinking of kunti and gaandhaari. they set their heart upon seeing dhritaraashtra in his forest retreat. sahadeva, lamenting the fate of kunti, and ex pressing his longing to see her, proposed a visit to the woods, supported by draupadi, who mentioned kunti and gaandhaari and dhritaraashtra. yudhishthira caused his army to be equipped, ordered litters, etc for the ladies, and proclaimed that they would march out to morrow, permitting the citizens to follow them. the next morning they set out, then waited five days for such citizens as would accompany them, and then proceeded towards the forest, headed by arjuna and kripa bhima on a gigantic elephant, the twins on two fleet steeds, the ladies in closed litters, scattering showers of wealth as they proceeded, headed by draupadi. they proceeded slowly. yuyutsu and dhaumya protected the city. they reached kurukshetra, crossed the yamunaa, and approached the retreat of dhritaraashtra . the paandavas and their followers, alighting from their cars, walked on foot the ascetics told them that dhritaraashtra had gone to the yamunaa for his ablutions, etc and pointed out the way to them. sahadeva ran with speed towards kunti they both wept she informed gaandhaari, and then advanced towards yudhishthira, etc dragging the childless old couple the paandavas fell n at their feet, and took from their hands the jars of water they were carrying. yudhi shthira presented all his followers one after another to dhritaraashtra, mentioning their names and races. dhrita raashtra rejoiced and went to his retreat that was applauded by si. and caa. . to the ascetics, who had come from various regions in order to see the paandavas, sanjaya pointed out each of them then dhritaraashtra asked yudhishthira about the welfare of the paandavas and their devotion to p. and . yudhishthira answered, enquiring after vidura, who turned out to be engaged in penances, subsisting on air alone, and was now seen at a distance with matted locks, and gravel in his mouth, and exceedingly emaciated, naked, and besmeared with filth and dust vidura fled, pursued by yudhishthira at last he stood motionless in yoga, and entered the body of yudhishthira, who felt that he had become stronger than before and had acquired many additional virtues and accomplishments, and recollected his own state before his birth among men he had heard of yoga practice from vyaasa. he desired to cremate the lifeless body of vidura, but was prevented by an invisible voice which said, that in vidura was yudhishthiras body also, and that vidura would attain to the regions called santaanikaa. yudhishthira came and informed dhritaraashtra all became filled with wonder. they passed that night under a tree, conversing on morality and wealth. the next morning they surveyed

who enquired after dhritaraashtras, etc welfare, and told them who vidura was, mentioning the curse of dharma by maandavya he was superior to brihaspati and shukra and how vyaasa had procreated him upon the soil of vicitravirya he was dharma in consequence of his practices of dhaaranaa and dhyaana from dharma also yudhishthira took his birth. vyaasa says that he has come to show a wonderful

in the city of manimati there lived formerly a daiteya ilvala, whose younger brother was vaataapi . ilvala, inflamed with wrath against all brahmans, because a brahman had refused to grant him a son equal to indra, used to transform vaataapi into a ram and offer his flesh to brahmans as food, and then to recall him to life, and vaataapi, ripping the flanks of the brahmans, would come out laughing. thus they killed many brahmans. meanwhile agastya saw his ancestors hanging in a hole with the heads nwards, and was asked by them to procure offspring to them. as he did not see any wife worthy of himself, he selected the most beautiful parts from various creatures and created an excellent woman, whom he caused to be born as the daughter of the vidarbha king, who was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining offspring. she was named lopaamudraa, and was very beautiful. when she attained to puberty no one dared to ask for her hand . when agastya asked the vidarbha king to bestow her upon him, the king and his queen became much afflicted, but at her own request lopaamudraa was bestowed upon agastya, who im mediately asked her to discard her ornaments and dress herself in rags and barks and deer skins and partake of his vows, and proceeding to gangaadvaara they practised the severest penances. when at last he summoned her for marital intercourse she made it a condition that he should approach her on a bed like to that which she had in the palace of her father, and that both should be aned with costly ornaments, and she told him to procure these things without impairing his ascetic merit . agastya then went to king shrutarvan and asked him for wealth, but seeing that his expenditure was equal to his income, he took nothing, but, together with shrutarvan, went to king bradhnashva, with the same result then all three went to king trasadasyu paurukutsa of the line of ikshvaaku, with the same result. at the suggestion of the three kings they all four went to ilvala . ilvala went out with his ministers to receive them on the confines of his ain. he prepared the flesh of vaataapi in order to entertain them, at which the kings became sad, but agastya ate it all, and when ilvala summoned vaataapi there came only air out of agastyas stomach, vaataapi having already been digested. then ilvala, becoming sad, promised to give them wealth if agastya could tell him what he intended to give, and agastya rightly said that he intended to give each of the kings, cows and as many gold coins, and to agastya twice as much, and a car that would be found to be a golden one, with two steeds . the car brought agastya and the kings to agastyas hermitage within the twinkling of an eye. then the raajarshis went away to their cities. when agastya proposed to lopaamudraa to choose between sons, or each equal to, or each equal to, or equal to, she chose the last alternative. after she had conceived he retired into the forest. after seven years she gave birth to drdhasyu, who came out as if repeating the vedas with the upanishads and angas and from carrying, while yet a child, loads of sacrificial fuel to the hermitage of his father, he was called idhmavaaha. agastya was highly pleased, and his ancestors obtained the lokas they desired. in the krita age the daanava tribes named kaalakeyas under vritra pursued the gods under indra. the gods, on the suggestion of brahmaan, with naaraayana at their head, proceeded to the hermitage of the rishi dadhica on the other bank of sarasvati, and having prevailed upon him to leave his body, they caused tvashtri to construct of his bones the six sided vajra which tvashtri handed to indra that he might slay vritra with it . in the encounter that ensued between the gods and the kaalakeyas the gods were defeated, until naaraayana, the gods, and the brahmarshis had transferred their own vigour to indra. he then hurled the vajra against vritra and slew him so that he fell headlong like the mandara mountain hurled of yore from vishnus hand but indra fled in fear, desiring to take shelter in a lake, thinking that the vajra had not been hurled from his hand and that vritra was still alive, while the gods defeated the daanavas, who fled to the depths of the sea. here they conspired for the destruction of the three worlds, and resolved upon destroying all who were possessed of ascetic virtues, for so the universe would itself be destroyed, as it is supported by asceticism . remaining in the depths of the sea by the kaaleyas during the night slew the munis in the hermitages and sacred spots in the hermitage of vasishtha, ascetics in that of cyavana, in that of bharadvaaja, without being seen every morning people saw the dead bodies and mutilated limbs of the munis and the disturbed agnihotras scattered on the ground. men fled for their lives into all directions or killed themselves from fear. some brave bowmen searched in vain for the evilrs. the gods with indra repaired to naaraayana . they did not know by whom the brahmans were being killed during the night. vishnu explained the whole affair to them, and told them to apply to agastya that he might dry up the sea, as no one else was capable of so ng. they then went to the hermitage of agastya, and mentioned to him that he had delivered the gods from nahusha and caused vindhya to cease to increase in height, the world having been covered with darkness . vindhya . at the request of the gods agastya, accompanied by rishis, gods, men, uragas, gandharvas, yakshas, and kimpurushas, approached the ocean and drank it up, to the amazement of the gods, who called him vidhaatri and the creator of the worlds, while the musical instruments of gandharvas were playing, and celestial blossoms were showered upon him. the kaaleyas, who had previously been burnt by the tapas of the munis, were now destroyed by the gods, except some few who, rending asunder the goddess earth, sought refuge in paataala. the gods now asked agastya to fill up the ocean again, but he had already digested the water. the gods with vishnu came to brahmaan and spoke to him about replenishing the sea . brahmaan dismissed them, saying that only after a long course of time the ocean would be brought to resume its wonted state by the agnates of king bhagiratha.

a part of khaandavadahanaparvan . questioned by janamejaya why agni desired to consume the forest of khaandava, vaishampaayana related it has been heard in the puraana that king shvetaki performed sacrifices so incessantly that his ritvijes left him, their eyes being afflicted with the continued smoke he then had his sacrifice completed by other ritvijes. he then desired to perform another sacrifice, which should extend over years. but he could not obtain any priests to assist him they told him to apply to rudra. he then went to kailaasa, and by observing the most rigid austerities he prevailed upon rudra that his sacrifice should be completed, on the condition that he could for twelve years without intermission pour libations of clarified butter into the fire, himself leading all the while the life of a brahmacaarin. when this had been e rudra said that he would not himself assist at the sacrifice, which properly belonged to the brahmans but he caused durvaasas to complete it. but agni became sick, because he had drunk clarified butter for twelve years, and applied to brahmaan. brahmaan told him to consume the forest of khaandava, that abode of the enemies of the gods, which he had of old once burnt to ashes at the request of the gods, together with its living population then he would regain his own nature. seven times agni, assisted by vaayu, set the forest on fire but the inhabitants extinguished the fire . a, a. agni again applied to brahmaan, who told him to solicit the old deities nara and naaraayana

the of the minor parvans of mhbhr aishika. the driver of dhrishtadyumnas chariot, who had managed to escape from kritavarman at a time when he was heedless, informs yudhishthira, in the morning, of the extermination of his army. yudhishthira falls n on the earth saatyaki holds him in his embrace bhima, etc stretch forth their arms. having recovered his senses yudhishthira laments and despatches nakula to bring thither draupadi and the ladies with her then he proceeds to view the slaughter in his camp, and falls n on the earth with all his followers . draupadi arrives from upaplavya, falls n in the presence of yudhishthira, is comforted by bhima, addresses yudhishthira, and resolves to sit in praaya, if the paandavas not slay ashvatthaaman. yudhishthira urged her to forget her sorrows, as ashvatthaa man is not to be found. draupadi insists on ashvatthaamans slaughter and the depredation of the gem on his head, appealing in particular to bhimasena . bhimasena, making nakula his charioteer, sets out in pursuit of ashvatthaaman, guided by the track of the latters car wheels . krishna urges yudhishthira to make arrangements for the safety of bhima, as ashvatthaaman has the brahma shiras weapon capable of exterminating all foes . the paandavas, with krishna, proceed on the track of bhima sena krishna, arjuna, and yudhishthira on krishnas car with steeds of the kaamboja breed shaibya on the right, sugriva on the left, meghapushpa and balaahaka being paarshnivaahas, the standard having been made by vishva karman and standing high like maayaa, with garuda. they in vain ask bhima to stop. they find ashvatthaaman sitting with vyaasa on the bank of gangaa in the midst of many ri. he is attired in a piece of cloth made of kusha grass, etc... he consecrates a blade of grass with mantras, and converts it into that powerful celestial weapon, and throws it off with the words for the destruction of the paandavas . urged by krishna, arjuna shoots the weapon imparted to him by drona, which was capable of neutralizing all weapons. extraordinary portents appear in nature. naarada and vyaasa, trying to save the three worlds, stand between the two fires . arjuna withdraws his weapon but ashvatthaaman is incapable of withdrawing his, as no person of uncleansed soul can bring it back, after it has once been let off, but only a brahmacaarin otherwise it strikes off his own head. vyaasa praises arjuna for not having before used the brahmashiras weapon that region where brahmashiras is baffled by another high weapon, suffers a drought for twelve years he proposes to him to give the paandavas the gem on his head then the paandavas would in return grant him his life. ashvatthaaman surrenders his gem, whose wearer ceases to have any fear from weapons, etc and from daa and n and raa. the weapon he throws into the wombs of the paandava women . krishna says that a brahman at upaplavya has said to uttaraa, while the kuru line will become extinct, a son will be born to thee, and he will for that reason be called parikshit. ashvatthaaman says that his words could not but be fulfilled. krishna says that the fœtus will die, but be recalled to a long life but ashvatthaaman shall wander for years alone, and without being able to talk to anyone the stench of pus and blood shall emanate from him, and inaccessible forests and dreary moors shall be his abode he shall wander over the earth with the weight of all diseases on him. parikshit shall learn the use of all weapons from kripa and rule the earth for sixty years krishna will revive him. vyaasa approves of krishnas curse. ashvatthaaman proceeds to the forest. the paandavas with krishna, vyaasa, and naarada, taking with them the gem, come to draupadi, who is sitting in praaya. bhima comforts draupadi . draupadi asks yudhishthira to place upon his head the gem taken from ashvatthaaman. yudhishthira asks krishna about the true cause of ashvatthaamans success in destroying the paandava army . krishna ascribes it to the aid of mahaadeva, and relates that when brahmaan, desirous of creating, saw rudra, he asked him to create living creatures rudra promised to so, and plunged into the waters and practised austerities. then brahmaan called into existence another being in order to make him the creator of living creatures, and he created daksha, etc. but they ran towards their creator from hunger, desirous of devouring him, and he repaired to brahmaan, who assigned herbs, etc as their food, and the weak beings to the strong ones. the creatures multiplied. then rudra rose from the water, became angry, and caused his productive limb to disappear in the earth. he had created food for all these creatures. then he went away, in cheerlessness and rage, to the munjavat mountains in order to practise severer austerities . after the krita age the gods prepared a sacrifice, but not knowing rudra truly they assigned no share to him. rudra constructed a bow of two of the four kinds of sacrifices, and came as a brahmacaarin to the sacrifice the earth shrank with fear, etc. rudra pierced the sacrifice in the heart it assumed the shape of a deer and fled away with agni, pursued by rudra through the skies the gods were stupefied rudra with his bow broke the arms of savitri and plucked out the eyes of bhaga and the teeth of pushan the gods uttered a cry the string of his bow burst the gods and the sacrifice gratified rudra he threw his wrath into the water that wrath, assuming the form of fire, is always employed in consuming the water. he then gave unto savitri his arms, to bhaga his eyes, and to pushan his teeth, and restored the sacrifice. the gods assigned to him all the libations of clarified butter as his share .

. . questioned by duryodhana why he would not slay shikhandin, bhishma said after shaantanus death and citraangadas demise, obedient to the counsels of satyavati installed, according to the ordinance, vicitravirya as king. repaired on a single car to the svayamvara of the daughters of the king of kaashi ambaa, ambikaa, and ambaalikaa, who were viryashalkaa. challenging all the kings, took the three maidens upon my car, and repeatedly told my name to the kings, and vanquished them all. then came back to haastinapura and made over those maidens, intending them for vicitravirya, to satyavati . satyavati became very glad. when the nuptials approached, ambaa said that she had before mentally chosen the shaalva king as her lord, and that he, without her fathers knowledge, had privately proposed to her . then laid the matter before satyavati and our counsellors, ritvijes, and purohitas, and permitted ambaa to depart. she came to the city of the shaalva king, escorted by a number of old brahmans, accompanied by her nurse. but he would no longer have her as his wife, because she was to be wedded to another. it was of no avail that she declared she had been carried away by force, weeping and against her will for shaalva was in terror of bhishma. she cursed bhishma, her father, herself, shaalva, and dhaatri . she resolved that her vengeance should fall upon bhishma. she repaired to a hermitage of ascetics, and stayed there that night. there was the great brahman shaikhaavatya, a preceptor in the scriptures and the aaranyakas . the ascetics counselled her to repair to her fathers abode but she would not, lest she should be slighted by her relatives she wished to practise ascetic austerities. then came her maternal grandfather, the srinjaya king, the r. ri. hotravaahana, and advised her to go to raama jaamadagnya, who would slay bhishma in battle if bhishma did not obey his behest he always dwelt on the mahendra mountain with ri g and aps. while they were speaking there appeared akritavrana, a dear companion of raama he said that raama would come the next morning to see hotravaahana hotravaahana related the history of ambaa to akritavrana . the next day raama appeared with his disciples, his bow in hand, etc. . ambaa asked him to slay bhishma . raama said he would not take up arms except at the command of brahmans. akritavrana supported the demand of ambaa. the next morning they all set out for kurukshetra with the maiden, and quartered themselves on the banks of sarasvati. on the third day raama sent a message to bhishma, who came and worshipped him. raama demanded that he should bestow ambaa upon vicitravirya, which bhishma refused. raama threatened to slay him in battle bhishma said that raama had himself taught him the four kinds of arms and quoted a shloka in the puraana, sung by marutta . having first gone to haastinapura and represented everything to satyavati, bhishma set out for kurukshetra on his car . gangaa in vain endeavoured to make them desist . bhishma asked raama to mount on a chariot but raama said that the earth was his chariot, the vedas his steeds, the wind his charioteer, and the mothers of the vedas his harness. bhishma saw him stationed on an excellent car, with akritavrana as his charioteer. bhishma propitiated raama by worshipping him, on foot. the combat lasted for many days at last bhishma, from pity and reverence, would not strike raama any longer, and the combat ceased at sunset . next morning the battle was taken up again. bhishmas vaayavya weapon was neutralized by raamas guhyaka bhishmas aagneya by raamas vaaruna. at a momentary swoon of bhishma, akritavrana, ambaa, etc were filled with joy then raama fell into a swoon and dropped n the ascetics and ambaa comforted him. a conflagration was caused in the welkin. at evening raama withdrew . the next day they fought again, and at evening they desisted . the next day bhishmas charioteer was slain bhishma, pierced by an arrow, fell n to the earth eight brahmans supported him on their arms in mid air gangaa was seen on his car she had controlled his steeds in the combat. bhishma dismissed her and fought till evening. when raama for a moment lost his consciousness, raahu enveloped the sun, etc. at evening the battle ceased next day it was taken up again, and lasted for twenty three days . during the night the above mentioned eight brahmans appeared to bhishma in a dream, comforted him, and said that the weapon prasvaapa would come to his knowledge, for it had been known to him in his former life neither raama nor any person on earth was acquainted with it raama would not be slain by it, but he would fall asleep then thou wilt awaken him with the weapon sambodhana . next day akritavrana must comfort raama. bhishma and raama both used the braahma weapon the welkin seemed to be ablaze, and as ri g and raa. were greatly afflicted, etc. then the mantras for using the prasvaapa weapon suddenly came to bhishmas mind . voices in the sky and naarada forbade him to let off the prasvaapa weapon against raama, and the above mentioned brahmans supported the words of naarada. beholding the prasvaapa weapon withdrawn, raama declared himself to be vanquished. raama then beheld before him his father and fathers father, who forbade him any more to fight with kshattriyas, especially with bhishma, whom the gods forbade to fight with raama. arjuna has been ordained by svayambhu to be the slayer of bhishma. the ascetics with ricika, naarada, gangaa, and the pitris succeeded in bringing about peace the above mentioned eight brahmans ordered. bhishma to go to raama, who, summoning ambaa, said that he could no more for her. ambaa went away, resolved to devote herself to austerities, that she might herself slay bhishma. raama with the ascetics departed for the mahendra mountain bhishma entered haastinapura, and was blessed by satyavati, and he appointed spies to ascertain the ngs of ambaa. bhishma became afflicted when he heard that she was resolved on ascetic austerities, but was consoled by naarada and vyaasa. after having lived for six months on air she stood a year in the waters of yamunaa, etc and thus went on for twelve years. she then went into vatsabhumi, etc. . gangaa, angry because she observed these vows for the destruction of bhishma, cursed her, saying that after death she would become a river crooked in her course, etc. when ambaa once more came back to vatsabhumi she there became the above mentioned river, but in con sequence of her ascetic merit, only with half her body, while as to the other half she remained a maiden as before . to the ascetics in vatsabhumi she said that she was resolved to obtain manhood in order to be revenged on bhishma. shiva appeared in his own form in the midst of those great rishis, and promised her that she would slay bhishma and even obtain manhood, and in a new body remember all the incidents born in the race of drupada, she would become a mahaaratha. then shiva disappeared. ambaa burnt herself on the bank of the yamunaa in the very sight of those great rishis . questioned by duryodhana how shikhandin, having before been born a girl, afterwards became a man, bhishma related the eldest queen of king drupada was childless. during those years drupada worshipped shankara for the sake of offspring, resolving to bring about bhishmas destruction, and practising the austerest of penances. he begged shiva for a son shiva said he should have a child who would be both female and male. in due time the queen conceived, and gave birth to a daughter, whom drupada gave out for a son, and called her shikhandin. bhishma alone, from his spies and from naarada, knew the truth . in arrows and weapons she became a disciple of drona. they afterwards wedded her to the daughter of the dashaarna king hiranyavarman, quite assured that the words of shiva would become true. shikhandin, after marriage, came back to kaampilya. at the discovery of shikhandins sex a war was about to break out with hiranyavarman . drupada was not naturally courageous, and became filled with fear, and, in the presence of others, asked his queen about the truth . the queen said that, childless as she was, when her daughter shikhandini was born she had, from fear of her co wives, told drupada that it was a son, remembering the words of shiva. drupada prepared for war, and, with the queen, prayed to the gods. shikhandini went to a forest, the haunt of the powerful yaksha sthunaakarna, who was a follower of kubera, resolved on putting an end to her own life. repeatedly requested by sthunaakarna to ask a boon, she told him the matter, and wished to become a man, as long as hiranyavarman had not left the city . he gave her his manhood and took her womanhood for a certain period, i.e. till hiranyavarman should have departed. shikhandin went home and informed drupada, who with his wife recollected the words of shiva. hiranyavarman sent a brahman as an envoy to kaampilya, threatening to ex terminate drupada with his counsellors, sons, etc. drupada sent a brahman as his envoy to hiranyavarman, maintaining that shikhandin was a male let it be made clear by means of witnesses somebody has spoken falsely to thee. hiranya varman despatched a number of young ladies for ascertaining it, and they attested that he was a male. hiranyavarman then passed some days with drupada in gladness, gave much wealth to shikhandin, and then departed, having rebuked his daughter. kubera, hearing the matter from the yakshas, cursed sthunaakarna, saying that his femininity should remain as it was as the yakshas began to soften him, he set a limit to the curse, i.e. shikhandins death. when shikhandin came to redeem his pledge, sthunaakarna related his curse and let him go. drupada gave shikhandin as a pupil to drona, who taught him the fourfold dhanurveda, along with the dhaartaraashtras and dhrishtadyumna. it was ambaa who had been born as shikhandin. bhishma had made a vow not to shoot weapons against a woman, or one that had before been a woman, or one bearing a feminine name, or one whose form resembled that of a woman . duryodhana asked in what time bhima, etc could annihilate the hostile army. bhishma said he could it in a month drona said the same kripa men tioned two months ashvatthaaman, ten nights karna, five nights. bhishma ridiculed karna, saying that he will think otherwise when he had encountered arjuna and krishna . having learnt this from his spies, yudhishthira asked arjuna the same question. arjuna said that with krishna as his ally he could exterminate the three worlds with the gods, etc in the twinkling of an eye the weapon given him by pashupati as a hunter, which pashupati used at the end of the yuga for destroying created things, was not known to bhishma, etc. he enumerated yudhishthiras allies yudhishthira was himself competent to exterminate the three worlds . next morning, under a cloudless sky, the kaurava army marched to the field, first vinda, etc. ashvatthaaman, etc in the second division in the rear, kritavarman, etc with the dhaartaraashtras at their head. duryodhanas encampment looked like a second haastinapura . in the same way yudhishthira also ordered out his troops, headed by dhrishtadyumna, under dhrishtaketu, etc first abhimanyu, etc. then bhima and arjuna in the second division last of all himself with viraata and drupada, etc. then he disposed his divisions in a different order, confounding the dhaartaraa shtras the draupadeyas, etc under bhimasena in the middle division, viraata, etc. in that part where yudhi shthira himself was, cekitaana, etc. . yudhishthira was followed by saucitti, etc .

animaandavya the rishi animaandavya having been accused of theft, though innocent, and impaled, as a punishment for having in his childhood pierced a little fowl in a reed, cursed dharma, saying that he should be born on earth in the shudra caste. therefore dharma was born as vidura, .
animaandavyopaakhyaana. the history of maandavya is more fully described. suspicion had fallen upon him, because thieves had hid their plunder in his hermitage, while he was sitting for years with his arms upraised observing the vow of silence. when impaled, he by his ascetic power not only preserved his life, but summoned other rishis to the scene, who came in the night in the shape of birds . hearing that he was alive, the king asked his par and endeavoured to extract the stake from his body, but was obliged to cut it off outside the body. maandavya henceforth walked about with the stake in his life, and thereby conquered lokas unattainable by others and was called animaandavya . he ruled that an act should not be sinful when committed by one below the age of years .

anudyutaparvan. when the paandavas had left haastinapura with all their wealth and jewels, dushaasana complained of it to duryodhana, who, with karna and shakuni, quoting the words of brihaspati when counselling indra about politics, and declaring that the paandavas would certainly revenge themselves, prevailed upon dhritaraashtra to invite them a second time to a match of gambling between yudhishthira and shakuni, on the condition that the defeated party should repair to the woods for twelve years, dressed in deer skins, and spend the thirteenth year in some inhabited country unrecognized, and if recognized, be exiled for another twelve years. if the paandavas should succeed in observing this vow for thirteen years, the dhaartaraashtras would in the meantime have made alliances and have assembled an invincible army, so that they could defeat them if they reappeared. drona, somadatta, baahlika, gautama, vidura, ashvatthaaman, vaishyaaputra, bhurishravas, bhishma, and vikarna dissuaded in vain . gaandhaari reminded dhritaraashtra of the counsel vidura had given, when duryo dhana was born, to kill him, and recommended him to it now, and not to let the gambling match take place, saying that it would cause the destruction of the whole race of the kurus. but dhritaraashtra could not act contrary to the will of his sons . the royal messengers overtook yudhishthira when he had already gone a long way. yudhishthira having said, although a golden animal was an impossibility, raama suffered himself to be tempted by a golden deer, they returned. the gambling began on the above mentioned conditions, and yudhishthira lost . the paandavas, casting off their royal robes, attired themselves in deer skins. dushaasana exulted, and exhorted krishnaa to aban the fallen paandavas and choose a husband among the kurus. as bhima rebuked him and threatened to slay him with his followers, dushaasana, dancing around, said, o cow o cow bhishma again swore to drink his blood and to kill all the dhaartaraashtras. as the paandavas were going away, duryodhana mimicked the tread of bhima, who then said will slay duryodhana with my mace, and place my foot on his head. dhananjaya will slay karna, and sahadeva will slay shakuni, and will drink the blood of dushaasana. arjuna and sahadeva approved of it. nakula, the handsomest of men, vowed to kill all the dhaartaraashtras that had insulted draupadi . yudhishthira bids farewell to bhishma, somadatta, baahlika, drona, kripa, ashvatthaaman, vidura, dhritaraashtra, the dhaartaraashtras yuyutsu, sanjaya, etc. vidura kept prithaa in his abode, and consoled yudhishthira formerly thou wast instructed on the himavat by meru saavarni, in vaaranaavata by dvaipaayana, on bhrigutunga by raama, on the drishadvati by shambhu, near anjana by the great rishi asita, by bhrigu on the banks of kalmaashi naarada always beholds thee, and this dhaumya is thy purohita, resolve to win victory like indra, to control thy wrath like yama, to give in charity like kuvera, to control all passions like varuna. so yudhishthira went away, bowing to bhishma and drona, . when krishnaa took leave of kunti, kunti broke out in complaints, and especially recommended her ever to keep her eye on sahadeva. when kunti beheld her sons clad in deer skins, surrounded by rejoicing foes, she embraced them and broke out in com plaints, asking why krishna, who dwells in dvaarakaa, and is without beginning and without end, s not deliver them from such woe. o sahadeva cease to go thou art my dearest child, o son of maadri the paandavas, having consoled her, set out for the woods, and vidura led her to his house. the ladies of dhritaraashtras house wept, blaming the kauravas and dhritaraashtra, anxious, sent for vidura . questioned by dhritaraashtra, vidura described the attitude of the paandavas, etc when going away . the citizens cried out in grief, blaming the kurus. flashings of lightning and other terrible omens appeared. naarada appeared, surrounded by great rishis, and foreboded that on the fourteenth year thence the kauravas would all be destroyed by bhima and arjuna. then he disappeared through the skies. duryodhana, karna, and shakuni offered the king to drona, who said that the paandavas were incapable of being slain that they would practise the brahmacarya for twelve years, and then return in anger that he would protect the dhaartaraashtras, who had sought his pro tection, to the best of his ability but that he would himself be slain by dhrishtadyumna, whom drupada had obtained from the fire by the ascetic power of yaaja and upayaaja it is widely known in the world that dhrishtadyumna will slay drona. dhritaraashtra sent vidura to bring the paandavas back, or, if they did not come back, to send them off with respect, with their weapons, cars, and infantry, etc. . sanjaya spoke to dhritaraashtra about the perversity of his policy. dhritaraashtra related that when krishnaa was dragged into the court the grief was so great that the enraged brahmans did not that evening perform their agnihotra he also related the omens which had appeared on the occasion,

. yudhishthira enquired of bhishma what should be e by a weak and timid king, as also by one that is in great distress. bhishmas answer recommending peace and even the surrender of territory. the king should never surrender his person as long as he can avoid ng so. if the invading enemy be righteous, the assailed king should make peace if otherwise, the assailed should fight bravely and fall . how a brahman should subsist in times of calamity. bhishma began his exposition of the moral standard of unlucky times in times of calamity the king may take from the wicked and give it to the good at such times censurable acts not become censurable the king should never oppress brahmans, even at such times. slander should be avoided. the tests of righteousness difficulty in finding the course of duty. some regard ancient usage as the highest test of righteousness they that are in favour of the conduct of cankha towards likhita not hold this opinion . how a king should fill his treasury. the king should establish laws which he should never transgress . the two duties of a kshattriya are the acquisition of religious merit and of wealth. the advantages of power . the old story of a robber who having in this world been observant of restraint did not meet with destruction in the next kaayavya carita . what wealth should not be taken by the king . who enjoy happiness shaakulopaakhyaana . . how a king should behave who is weak and threatened on all sides by powerful foes the old story of the mouse, the cat, the owl, the mongoose, and the hunter, i.e. maarjaara mushika samvaada . the moral of the story . bhishma related the conversation between the bird pujani and king brahmadatta, i.e. brahmadatta pujani samvaada . how a king should behave when there is a general decadence of righteousness the old story of the discourse between bhaaradvaaja and king shatrunjaya, i.e. kanikopadesha . how a brahman should live when there is terrible distress around. bhishma said that the krita, etc are all dependent on the kings conduct, citing the old story of the discourse between vishvaamitra and the caandaala in a hamlet inhabited by caandaalas. towards the end of tretaa and the beginning of dvaapara a frightful drought occurred extending over twelve years the planet brihaspati began to move in a retrograde course, and soma receded towards the south, etc. the brahmans abstained from sacrifices and recitations of the vedas, and no longer uttered vashats, etc. the very rishis, giving up their vows, began to wander hither and thither. m. ri. vishvaamitra, leaving his wife and son, wandered fireless and homeless, and regardless of food, clean and unclean. one day he came upon a hamlet, in the midst of a forest, inhabited by cruel hunters, etc. . vishvaamitra, in rage of hunger, wanted to steal a s haunch . he was discovered and harshly addressed by the owner but when the caandaala learned who he was he addressed him respectfully, and dissuaded him from eating s meat, as the is less clean than a jackal, and the haunch of a is much worse than other parts of his body only the five kinds of five clawed animals are clean food for brahmans and kshattriyas and vaishyas, as laid n in the scriptures . vishvaamitra said that it is the duty of the brahmans to behave like agni, that the vedas are fire, and that fire at times becomes a consumer of everything life is better than death if living one may acquire virtue he mentioned that agastya, when hungry, ate up the asura vaataapi . notwithstanding the warnings of the caandaala, vishvamitra took away that haunch of s meat into the woods and wished to eat it with his wife, having gratified the gods and the pitris igniting a fire according to the braahma rites and cooking a caru according to the aindraagneya rites, dividing the caru into due portions, he invoked the gods, including indra. meanwhile indra began to pour rain copiously. vishvaamitra, having completed the rites, himself ate that meat. afterwards he destroyed all his sins by his penances and acquired the most wonderful success . yudhishthira was distressed at the possibility of such acts of impiety being mentioned as a duty. bhishma said that kings should gather wis from various sources, and not from the vedas alone. those who blame the injunctions of the scriptures, etc are hucksters in learning and raakshasas among men it has been heard by us that the texts of morality cannot be understood solely by discussion or by ones own intellect indra has said that this is the opinion of brihaspati... in days of old ushanas told the daiteyas this truth, that scriptures are no scriptures if they cannot stand the test of reason...the sin of killing a person is equal to the sin of not killing one that deserves to be killed. indra has said that in times of distress the great duty of a king is chastising the wicked and protecting the good . yudhishthira enquired after the merits of protecting suppliants. bhishma, reminded of shibi, etc told the story that bhaargava had recited to king mucukunda, how a pigeon won success, i.e. kapota lubdhaka samvaada . requested by yudhishthira about how a person can be purified after having committed sin from want of judgment, bhishma related the old tale, applauded by ri of what the brahman indrota shaunaka said to janamejaya, i.e. indrota paarikshitiya . asked by yudhishthira if he had ever seen or heard of any mortal restored to life after having succumbed to death, bhishma related the story of the discourse between a vulture and a jackal as it had happened of old in the forest of naimisha, i.e. gridhra gomaayu samvaada . yudhishthira asked bhishma as to how a weak king who incurs the wrath of a powerful one should behave in the hour of danger. bhishma told the story of the discourse between pavana and the shaalmali, who, having dared the wind god, saved himself by causing his branches to be lopped off pavana shaalmali samvaada . one should over look the wrongs inflicted by a person of superior strength, and even consider them like the acts of a child, an idiot, or one that is blind or deaf. the eighteen akshauhinis were not equal in might to arjuna . covetousness is the cause of sin it is not known in its real nature by g as m. u etc. . discourse on ignorance it has its origin in covetousness janaka, etc acquired heaven in consequence of their having repressed covetousness . the moral laws laid n by m. ri. are many the highest among them all is self restraint it surpasses charity and sacrifice and study of the vedas . penance is the root of everything by penance prajaapati created the universe, etc and ri. acquired the vedas and acquired their sixfold divine attributes renunciation constitutes the highest penance . discourse on truth and its indications it is applauded by brahmans, ri and p. it is yoga, it is brahmaan, sacrifice, etc. it has been found to weigh heavier than, horse sacrifices . discourse on the thirteen vices that are powerful foes of all all these thirteen faults stained the sons of dhritaraashtra . the characteristics of malevolent persons . how brahmans should be provided for. at the end of every year one should perform the vaishvaanara sacrifice . the practice of an act laid n in an alternative is not destructive of virtue fearing death, . saa the brahmans, and m. ri. make use of the alternative instead of the principal rule in seasons of distress. the five kinds of falsehood that are not sinful. the three sins that cannot be expiated. acts that are never sinful . different kinds of expiation for different kinds of sin . questioned by nakula, bhishma related khadgotpattikathana . when bhishma became silent yudhi shthira returned home. yudhishthiras question to vidura and his own brothers about the three things . vidura assigned precedence to virtue. arjuna assigned precedence to wealth . nakula and sahadeva assigned the precedence to both wealth and virtue. bhimasena assigns precedence to desire . yudhishthira applauded withdrawal from the three things, recommending emancipation or extinction, and quoted brahmaan. all of them were filled with delight and applauded yudhishthira, who once more addressed bhishma . asked by yudhishthira with whom friendship is delightful, bhishma, having also stated with whom friendship should be avoided, related an old story that had occurred in the country of the mlecchas, that lies to the north, about an ungrateful person, i.e. kritaghnopaakhyaana . bhishmas observations on ingratitude .

. asked by janamejaya, vaishampaayana related what the paandavas did after having rescued krishnaa . the paandavas left kaamyaka and returned to dvaitavana with krishnaa. once a deer carried off a brahmans arani and mantha, was pursued by the paandavas, and suddenly became invisible. bhima repented that he had not slain the praatikaamin, arjuna that he had not slain karna, and sahadeva that he had not slain shakuni. nakula, sahadeva, arjuna, and bhima were suc cessively sent to fetch water, but caused to drop n dead by a yaksha. at last yudhishthira himself went, answered thirty four questions put by the yaksha, chose that nakula should be revived, rescued all his brothers, learnt that the yaksha was his father dharma, was granted the boon that the brahman would recover his arani and mantha, that the paandavas would manage to live the thirteenth year un recognized in viraatas king, and that yudhishthira should overcome covetousness, etc. the paandavas asked permission of the brahmans to live the thirteenth year in concealment from the dhaartaraashtras, duryodhana, etc and karna and saubala. dhaumya, etc consoled yudhishthira even the gods have wandered in disguise for the purpose of overcoming foes. the brahmans went back to their homes, and the paandavas and dhaumya set out with krishnaa, and the next day proceeded for a krosha, and then sat n in order to take counsel of each other.

aaranyakaparvan . the paandavas set out from haastinapura through the vardhamaana gate with their weapons, accompanied by krishnaa, in a northerly direction. indrasena and other servants, in number, with their wives, followed them on swift cars. the citizens wished to leave the town and follow them, but were prevailed upon by yudhishthira to return and cherish bhishma, dhritaraashtra, vidura, kunti, etc. about the close of the day the paandavas reached the banian pramaana on the banks of the gangaa, purified them selves by touching the water, and passed the night there, taking water alone as their sole sustenance, in the company of brahmans with and without fire, who had followed them . when the day broke in, yudhishthira tried to prevail upon the brahmans to leave him, in order that they might not undergo sufferings, living on fruits, roots, and deer. but they declared that they would follow him, themselves providing their own food. then a learned brahman, shaunaka, versed in saankhya and yoga, quoting the shlokas of janaka, told yudhishthira not only to retire from the world, but also in his heart not to mind the loss of his wealth. yudhishthira declared that it was not from avarice, but only because he could no more support the brahmans, that he regretted his wealth nobody should cook his food for himself alone, and nobody should slay an animal without devoting it to the gods, the pitris, and guests, nor should one eat of that food which had not been duly dedicated to the gods and the pitris. shaunaka said that sacrifices, study, gifts, and penance pave the way to the world of the pitris truth, forgiveness, subduing the senses, and renunciation of desire to the heaven of the gods, and they should be practised without reference to self . it was by their wealth of yoga that the rudras, saadhyas, aadityas, vasus, and ashvins rule over the creatures. so yudhishthira, who had already achieved success as to his indebtedness towards his ancestors and as to sacrifices, now ought to seek success in yoga and in ascetic austerities then he would be able to realize all his wishes . yudhishthira then, having consulted dhaumya, was taught by him names of surya, proclaimed by svayambhu . yudhishthira, touching the water of gangaa, with his senses under control, and feeding upon air alone, stood engaged in praanaayaama, and began a hymn in praise of surya . the sun then showed himself to yudhishthira and gave him a copper vessel, saying that if paancaali kept this vessel fruits, roots, meat, and vegetables, cooked in their kitchen, would be inexhaustible for twelve years. then the god vanished. rising from the water, yudhishthira took hold of dhaumyas feet and embraced his brothers. the clean food that was dressed, however little, became inexhaustible, and only after the brahmans, the brothers, yudhishthira, and at last krishnaa had eaten the days food became exhausted. having then performed sacrifices, they set out for the kaamyaka wood, accompanied by dhaumya and the brahmans . dhritaraashtra asked vidura what they should to secure the good will of the citizens. vidura said that he must give back to the paandavas all that had been theirs, let duryodhana, shakuni, and karna wait upon them, and dushaasana ask their forgiveness in open court, and if duryodhana would not consent to reign in peace jointly with yudhishthira, he ought to aban him and let yudhishthira reign alone. dhritaraashtra did not approve, and saying stay or go, as thou listest, he suddenly rose and went away, and vidura went away to the paandavas . starting from the gangaa, the paandavas went to kurukshetra, performed ablutions in the sarasvati, drishadvati, and yamunaa, and, travelling in a westerly direction, they arrived at the kaamyaka wood on the sarasvati. there vidura came to them in a single car. when seeing him, yudhishthira was afraid that he brought an invitation to a new match at dice with shakuni about their weapons. vidura told them that he had been forsaken by dhritaraashtra, and gave them advice how to secure adherents . after vidura had gone dhritaraashtra repented and fell n senseless, and having regained consciousness caused sanjaya to bring vidura back . duryodhana, being afraid because vidura had returned, held counsel with shakuni, karna, and dushaasana, who were of opinion that the paandavas would remain the promised space of time in the wood. as duryodhana, however, was not contented, karna proposed to set out and slay them. when they had gone out krishna dvaipaayana came upon them and commanded them to desist, and then appeared before dhritaraashtra . vyaasa warned dhritaraashtra against permitting duryodhana to try to slay the paandavas . as dhritaraashtra said he was unable to cast off his senseless son, vyaasa told him one when indra saw surabhi weeping in heaven, and asked her why she wept, she told him that one of her offspring was exceedingly harassed by a husbandman and although she had, offspring, and her affections flowed equally towards all, yet she felt greater compassion for the weak. indra poured n a shower of rain and caused obstruction to the husbandmans work. so feel anxious regarding the paandavas in distress let thy affections be greater towards the weak, and let duryodhana make peace with them . maitreya shaapa .

. on the abhishecaniya day maharshis and naaraada entered the antarvedi and sat n together with the raajarshis engaged in various topics of conversation and dispute. no shudra was then near the antarvedi, nor anybody without vows . naarada sat there with feelings of awe, remembering the words he had heard of old in the mansion of brahmaan regarding the incarnation of the deities, and knowing that krishna was the incarnation of naaraayana and would himself destroy all these assembled kshattriyas. bhishma then proposed to yudhishthira that arghas should be offered to the kings, and first to him who was the foremost. as bhishma declared krishna to be foremost, he caused sahadeva to present the first argha to krishna, which filled the cedi king shishupaala with envy . shishupaala gravely censures bhishma, yudhishthira, and krishna, and accompanied by the kings left the assembly . yudhishthira ran after shishupaala and spoke sweetly to him in order to conciliate him bhishma maintained the fitness of giving krishna the first argha . saahadeva and naarada declared it to be highly improper not to worship krishna. sunitha stirred the kings up in order to obstruct the completion of the sacrifice .

. yudhishthira spoke to krishna about the mission of sanjaya and the wickedness of duryodhana and dhritaraashtra though he was supported by the kaashis, etc he asked for only five villages or towns, and complained of the cruel duties of the kshattriya order. krishna said he was willing to go to the kuru court in order to negotiate a peace, and yudhishthira, after some hesitation, agreed to the proposal . krishna mentioned the offences of the kauravas, and said that he thought war to be certain all the omens pointed in that direction therefore yudhishthira should collect everything needed for battle . bhima told krishna to speak mildly and not threaten the kurus with war. just as, when dharma became extinct, kali was born in the race of the asuras, who flourished with prosperity and blazed with energy, so was udaavarta born among the haihayas, etc. . these vile individuals sprang up, at the end of each yuga, in their respective races for the destruction of their kinsmen so has duryodhana been born at the end of the yuga among us the kurus. yudhishthira and arjuna too are averse from war . krishna scoffed at bhima for his unusual mildness, though he had sworn, as the sun journeyed around meru, to slay duryodhana with his mace . bhima mentioned his well known valour, and said that he was for bearing their injuries, only for fear lest the bharata race might be extirpated . krishna explained that he had only spoken through affection . arjuna told krishna to strive sincerely to bring about peace for he was able to whatever he would but if krishna deemed the destruction of the kurus to be preferable, let it be effected soon he mentioned the offences of duryodhana towards themselves and draupadi. at all events, krishna best knew what was for their good . krishna said he would try to bring about what was beneficial to both the paandavas and the kurus to make peace was within his power he would all that could be e by human exertion, but he could not control destiny duryodhana, etc would never make peace by giving up the king many a time he had tried to withdraw krishna from arjuna about a year ago, on the occasion of attacking viraatas kine, bhishma had solicited duryodhana about this very peace . nakula told krishna to act according to his own opinion, disregarding all he had heard. their attachment for the king was now greater than ever, as nobody could encounter yudhishthira, etc. . he should first speak mildly and then threaten duryodhana. he did not bt that he would accomplish his object, for vidura, etc would understand him . sahadeva said that krishna ought to provoke a war, because of the insults to draupadi. saatyaki approved of this, and thus did all the heroes present . krishnaa approved of the words of sahadeva and saatyaki, mentioned weeping the injustice of the dhaartaraashtras, and that they had refused to give even five villages, avisthala, etc and was of opinion that there was no necessity for going thither in order to make peace. krishna consoled her thou wilt soon see thy husbands slay their enemies, and crowned by prosperity . arjuna once more besought krishna to try to make peace. on the next morning, at the maitra hour, in the month of kaumuda, under the constellation revati, at the season of dews, autumn having departed, krishna caused shinis grandson saatyaki to prepare his chariot they yoked to it shaibya, sugriva, meghapushpa, and balaahaka. garuda came and perched on the flagstaff. and taking saatyaki also upon it, he set out under auspicious omens vasishtha, etc and . ri. and b. ri. walked around him . yudhishthira, etc followed him on the way, and told him to salute kunti, etc. . arjuna said he was for peace, but if duryodhana would not give them what they demanded, he would annihilate the kshattriya race. bhima uttered a terrible shout, so that the bowmen trembled in fear, and steeds and elephants were seen to void urine and fæces. when all the kings had desisted following him, krishna set out with daaruka. on his way he met with some rishis, and jamadagnis son, the friend of brahmaan, told him that the . ri brahmans, and r. ri who had witnessed the former feats of gods and asuras, had come to see and hear the assemblage at haastinapura . ten chariot warriors followed in krishnas train, and foot soldiers and attendants by hundreds, carrying provisions in abundance. sinister omens occurred over haastinapura but where krishna passed everything became auspicious. at vrikasthala he passed the night . meanwhile dhritaraashtra, having heard from his spies that krishna was coming, respect fully addressed bhishma, etc and said to duryodhana and his counsellors that krishna should be received with the greatest honour let pavilions be set up on the road, etc. bhishma, etc approved of it, and duryodhana made the arrangements. but krishna did not even glance at it . when krishna was staying at vrikasthala and intended to come to haastinapura the next morning, dhritaraashtra spoke to vidura about how he in tended to treat krishna in order to honour him . vidura blamed dhritaraashtra for his insincerity the right hospitality to be offered to krishna is to make peace with the paandavas, and thou wilt not give them even five villages, and seekest only to separate krishna from the paandavas . duryodhana said that it was of no use to bestow wealth and honour upon krishna, as he could never be separated from the paandavas, and he will only think that we are worshipping him out of fear. bhishma advised them to as krishna would say. duryodhana declared that he would imprison krishna. dhritaraashtra and all his counsellors became deeply afflicted, especially as krishna came as an ambassa. inflamed with rage, bhishma rose and left the place . the next morning krishna rose at daybreak and arrived in haastinapura, and was solemnly received by all the dhaartaraashtras, etc and the citizens . having saluted dhritaraashtra, etc he went to the abode of vidura . in the afternoon he visited kunti, who wept for her sons, comparing yudhi shthira to ambarisha, etc mentioning the feats of bhima sena, comparing arjuna to kaartavirya, etc and also inquiring about sahadeva and nakula, and likewise about draupadi, mentioning how she was dragged by dushaasana, while baahlika, etc grieved but especially she praised vidura. full years have gone since duryodhana first exiled my son. she mentioned the invisible voice on the night of arjunas birth, and trusted to dharma and the creator and krishna. she asked krishna to tell her sons that she besought them to avenge themselves and draupadi, as even death was better than a life gained by meanness. krishna consoled her, and then departed for duryodhanas mansion . krishna entered duryodhanas palace, where he also beheld dushaasana, karna, and shakuni. duryodhana asked him to dine at his house but krishna did not accept the invitation, because he hated the paandavas, and went to viduras abode, where drona, etc came to him . vidura warned krishna against duryodhana, who would never make peace, because he trusted bhishma, etc and distrusted krishna . krishna said that he knew duryodhana but great would be the merit earned by him who liberates the whole earth from the noose of death and even if he should meet failure, the merit of that intended act would become his moreover, have come here in order that unrighteous, foolish, and inimical persons shall not afterwards be free to say that krishna made no attempt to restrain them from slaughtering one another, though he was competent to so. then he laid himself n for sleep . in the morning duryodhana and shakuni came and invited him to go to the council where dhritaraashtra and bhishma, etc were present he rode thither in his chariot with daaruka, putting on his gem kaustubha, and being protected by the vrishnis, and he was followed by vidura in his own chariot, and by duryodhana and shakuni in one chariot, and by saatyaki and kritavarman and the other chariot warriors of the vrishni race in chariots and on steeds and elephants . then he entered the court with vidura and saatyaki before him sat karna and duryodhana, behind him the vrishnis with kritavarman. bhishma, drona, etc with dhritaraashtra rose up in his honour, etc. he beheld the rishis staying in the skies with naarada at their head, and caused bhishma to offer them seats. dushaasana gave a seat to saatyaki, and vivimshati one to kritavarman . krishna spoke of the just complaints and claims of the paandavas, and said that with them as his allies dhritaraashtra would become invincible, having bhishma, etc. . let not the peoples of the earth be exterminated if thou regainest thy natural disposition, the earth may continue to be peopled as now. all the kings there present highly applauded the words of krishna in their hearts, but none of them ventured to say anything in the presence of duryodhana . jaamadagnya then told dambhodbhavopaakhyaana . great, indeed, was that feat of old achieved by nara. naaraayana again became superior to nara in consequence of many additional qualities. therefore, o king, before such weapons as kaakudika, etc are placed on the string of the gaandiva, go thou to dhananjaya, laying aside thy pride these weapons have other names corresponding to the eight passions . maataliyopaa khyaana . after kanva had spoken, krishna, bhishma, and naarada in vain admonished duryodhana. naarada related the old story gaalavacarita, and the fall of yayaati . dhritaraashtra complained that duryodhana never listened to his, etc words, and asked krishna to admonish him. krishna reminded duryodhana of what was agreeable to dhritaraashtra, etc and warned him against dushaasana, etc. . bhishma, etc could not fight against bhima and arjuna, who had vanquished g y as and pn. at khaandavaprastha who encountered many at viraatas city, etc. . bhishma, drona, vidura, and dhritaraashtra recommended duryodhana to follow the counsels of krishna . bhishma and drona warned duryodhana against krishna, etc. . duryodhana complained that krishna always censured him in the match of dice blame could not be attached to him. he quoted this saying of maatanga, one should always keep himself erect... . krishna indignantly answered duryodhana, men tioning his offences against the paandavas, vaaranaavata, etc. . dushaasana said to duryodhana that the kauravas would bind him, and bhishma, drona, and dhritaraashtra would make duryodhana, karna, and dushaasana over to the paandavas. disregarding vidura, etc duryodhana went out of the court in anger. krishna blamed them for not having forcibly seized and bound duryodhana think the time has come for ng this he reminded them of how he had himself slain kamsa, and then installed ugrasena on the throne, for the benefit of all the yaadavas, andhakas, and vrishnis and that when the gods and asuras, etc were arrayed for battle parameshthin had commanded dharma to bind the daiteyas and the daanavas and make them over to varuna, who having bound them with dharmas noose and also with his own, kept them within the depths of the ocean. in the same way they ought to bind duryodhana, etc. . dhritaraashtra caused vidura to fetch gaandhaari, who blamed dhritaraashtra, because he had by his indulgence caused duryodhana now to be the slave of delusion and incapable of being turned back she then caused vidura to fetch duryodhana, whom she rebuked severely and asked to obey the words of his well wishers dhritaraashtra, etc. bhishma and dhritaraashtra and baahlika gave the paandavas their share from fear of a disunion. if bhishma, etc became enraged the population of the earth would be exterminated. the affection of bhishma, drona, and kripa towards the paandavas and the dhaartaraashtras was equal it is never seen in this world that men acquire wealth by avarice . disregarding the words of his mother, duryodhana again went away in anger, and began to consult with shakuni, and duryodhana, etc resolved upon seizing krishna then the paandavas with the somakas would become depressed. saatyaki knew it, caused kritavarman to array the troops at the entrance of the court, and informed krishna, dhritaraashtra, and vidura, but laughed at the project. vidura told dhritaraashtra that the last hour of all his sons was at hand. krishna said to dhritaraashtra that if his sons perpetrated such a deed yudhishthiras object would be accomplished, for this very seizing them with all who follow them, can make them over to the paandavas will not, however, commit any such censurable deed that can proceed only from wrath and a sinful understanding. dhritaraashtra once more caused vidura to fetch duryodhana with his brothers, etc and rebuked them t thou not know krishna, who is incapable of being defeated in battle by men, g as and u. vidura reminded duryodhana that at the gates of saubha the monkey dvivida covered krishna with a shower of stones, but could not seize him nor could naraka with all the daanavas at praagjyotisha slaying naraka, krishna brought away, damsels and married them all. in the city of nirmocana, mighty asuras failed to seize him with their nooses. he also mentioned putanaa shakuni, etc. . krishna reminded duryodhana that he was not alone, and from his body issued myriads of gods, etc. all the kings were terrified and closed their eyes, except bhishma, drona, vidura, sanjaya, and the rishis for krishna gave them celestial sight, etc. then he went out with saatyaki and kritavarman. the rishis naarada, etc vanished. he found daaruka waiting with his chariot drawn by shaibya, and kritavarman, who had mounted his chariot. dhritaraashtra excused himself, saying that he was powerless. krishna bade farewell to dhritaraashtra, etc and set out, followed by bhishma, etc to the abode of kunti . kunti asked him to admonish yudhishthira to attend to the duties of his own order, and not contemplate virtue alone, citing mucukunda . it is the king that creates the krita, tretaa, or dvaapara age if he creates the krita age, he enjoys heaven exceedingly if he creates the tretaa, he enjoys heaven, but not exceedingly if he causes the dvaapara age to set in, he enjoys heaven according to his due if he promotes the kali age, he will reside in hell for countless years. that understanding according to which thou art now acting, is not in accordance with the intentions of paandu, or myself, or thy grandsire, when we uttered blessings on thee before, etc. . in this connection is cited an old story . vidulaaputrashaasana . kunti asked krishna to remind arjuna of the voice heard at his birth to bhima he should say that the time has come for that in view of which a kshattriya lady brings forth a son krishnaa he should praise for her behaviour towards the paandavas he should remind nakula and sahadeva, that they must not forgive the insults towards draupadi, that was worse than the defeat at dice and the exile arjuna should always tread in the path pointed out by draupadi bhima and arjuna are a pair of yamas capable of slaying the very gods they should revenge the harsh words said by dushaasana to bhima. krishna bade farewell to bhishma, etc took karna upon his chariot and set out with saatyaki, deliberating with karna for a long time. then he dismissed karna, and driven by daaruka the steeds soon reached upaplavya. the kurus assembled and talked about krishna . bhishma and drona reminded duryodhana of what kunti had said to krishna, and the exploits of arjuna they recommended peace fearful omens appeared . duryodhana was cheerless and silent. bhishma complained. drona said that his affection for arjuna was greater than for ashvatthaaman duryodhana ought to have followed the counsels of the elders yudhishthira was invincible the paandavas had procured wealth from kuberas abode the periods of our lives have run out etc. . requested by dhritaraashtra, sanjaya related the conversation between krishna and karna . krishna disclosed to karna that he was virtually the son of paandu, and on the side of his father was related to the paandavas, on the side of his mother to the vrishnis. he ought to come with him to the paandavas, being the elder brother of yudhishthira, and be installed as king by dhaumya, etc yudhishthira being his heir presumptive and ruling the king under him during the sixth period draupadi also will come to thee let the dravidas, etc walk before thee . karna admitted that he was virtually the son of paandu, kunti having, while a maiden, born him to surya and then abaned him. but the suta adhiratha had taken him to his home from her affection for him raadhaas breasts were filled with milk that very and she held his urine and fæces how can one like us....deprive her of her pinda adhiratha regarded karna as a son, and karna regarded adhiratha as a father he had caused all the rites of infancy to be performed on karna according to the scriptures he had caused the name vasushena to be bestowed upon him by the brahmans when karna attained to youth he married wives according to adhirathas selection with them he had begotten sons and grandsons. through duryodhana he had enjoyed sovereignty for thirteen years. his many sacri fices had always been with sutas, as had also his family rites and marriage rites. it was only after having got hold of karna that duryodhana had decided upon war with the paandavas, karna having been chosen as the antagonist of arjuna. their discourse ought to be kept secret, lest yudhi shthira should refuse to accept the king and if the empire becomes mine shall certainly make it over to duryodhana only. he praised yudhishthira, etc and the weapons of arjuna, comparing the combat to a sacrifice and bhimas drinking the blood of dushaasana to the soma drinking, etc. . krishna said the victory of the paandavas was very certain he described arjunas banner, made by bhaumana by celestial illusion his aindra, aagneya, and maaruta weapons, etc. then all signs of the krita, tretaa, and dvaapara ages will disappear. he forebade bhimasenas dancing, having quaffed the blood of dushaasana, etc. . returning hence, say to bhishma, etc that the present month is a delightful one days hence it will be the day of the new moon, presided over by indra let the battle commence then . karna ascribed the approaching destruction to shakuni, etc and mentioned diverse sinister visions of planets, etc and he had seen in a vision, foreboding victory, yudhishthira, etc and the inverse respecting bhishma, etc. . karna embraced krishna, descended from his chariot, and riding in his own chariot, which was decked with gold, came back with us . vidura approached kunti and spoke of the state and disposition of yudhishthira, etc and the allies of yudhishthira . kunti thought with grief on those who were going to fight . especially she was afraid of karna she recollected the boon of durvaasas and its consequences . she went to karna, who was standing performing his prayers on the bank of gangaa with his face turned towards the east and his arms upraised and she stayed behind him, waiting for the completion of his prayers. then, turning round, he beheld kunti . kunti disclosed to karna his birth, mentioned the justice of the paandava cause and the injustice of duryodhanas, and besought him to join the paandavas . surya corroborated the words of kunti. but karna represented to her the great injury she had e him he could not now frustrate the hope of the kauravas but except arjuna thy other sons shall not be slain by me. they then left the spot, turning into different directions . at upaplavya krishna represented to the paandavas all that had happened at haastinapura. in the night, yudhi shthira again brought krishna into their midst, and caused him to repeat what had been said by bhishma, etc. bhishma had related his own life he mentioned a duel with raama, where vicitravirya fled, having been deserted by his subjects upon vicitraviryas death anarchy prevailed in the king, and indra did not give a drop of rain afflicted by hunger and maladies, the subjects then asked bhishma in vain to ascend the throne when paandu became king, his sons must obtain their paternal inheritance . drona had related the life of paandu. vidura had asked bhishma to go to the woods with him and dhritaraashtra, or to bind duryodhana and rule the king with the paandavas. gaandhaari proved that the king by right belonged to the paandavas and their sons and grandsons, and to no others . dhritaraashtra had repeated to duryodhana the genealogy of the kuru race from soma, mentioning especially that yayaati had placed his youngest son puru on the throne and that devaapis installation was forbidden by the brahmans and all aged persons because of a skin disease, and as baahlika abaned his father and brother and obtained the wealthy king of his maternal uncle, shaantanu, the youngest of the three brothers, became king. being defective of a limb, was likewise excluded by paandu at his death the king must pass to his sons ...thou art not the son of a king, and therefore hast no right to the king . krishna continued his relation duryodhana had repeatedly instructed the kings, saying to day is pushya march ye. eleven akshauhinis have been assembled headed by bhishma .

caitrarathaparvan . within a few days there came a brahman to the abode of their host, whom they asked to narrate the birth of dhrishtadyumna from the sacrificial fire, and that of krishnaa from the centre of the vedi, and that of shikhandin, and how dhrishtadyumna learnt the use of all weapons from drona, and how the friendship of drona and drupada was broken . the brahman related the birth of drona, his friendship with drupada, and his visit to raama, the breaking of his friendship with drupada, how bhishma prevailed upon him to teach the princes, etc and the chastisement of drupada . draupadi sambhava . hearing the words of the brahman, the sons of kunti seemed to be, as it were, pierced with darts. kunti proposed to yudhishthira that they should go to the paancaalas, a country they had not seen before, and he consented for his part. when the other brothers had likewise consented, they set out for the town of drupada . when they were living disguised, vyaasa came and told them that formerly the daughter of a rishi, notwith standing her beauty, obtained no husband, and therefore by austerities propitiated shankara five times, saying give me a husband. accordingly the god said that she should in a future life have five husbands. that damsel is krishnaa, appointed to be the wife of ye all go therefore to the capital of the paancaalas and dwell ye there. he then left them . after vyaasa had gone away, the paandavas proceeded in a northerly direction, walking day and night till they reached the tirtha somaashrayaayana . then they arrived at the gangaa dhananjaya walked before them, torch in hand. the gandharva king with his wives was then sporting there in the gengaa. bending his bow to a circle, he said, excepting the first lavas, the muhurta that begins with the twilight preceding nightfall has been appointed for the yakshas, gandharvas, and raakshasas, capable of going everywhere at will the rest has been appointed for man to his work. if therefore men, wandering during those moments from greed of gain, come near us, both we and the raakshasas slay those fools. therefore persons acquainted with the vedas never applaud those men, who then approach any piece of water. stay ye at a distance. know that am angaaraparna, the friend of kubera, and this my forest is also called angaaraparna, where neither kaunapas, nor shringins, nor gods, nor men can come. arjuna replied whether it be night, or twilight, who can bar others from the ocean, the himaalaya, and gangaa . arjuna burnt the gandharvas chariot with the aagneya weapon, given by brihaspati to bharadvaaja, by him to agniveshya, by him to drona, by drona to arjuna, and dragged him, who had become unconscious, by the hair. his wife kumbhinasi prevailed upon yudhishthira, and he commanded arjuna to spare him. he declared that, instead of his former name, citraratha, he should now be called dagdharatha, and imparted to arjuna the gaandharvi vidyaa called caakshushi . he also gave arjuna and each of his brothers one hundred horses born in the country of the gandharvas, endued with the speed of wind and employed in carrying the gods and gandharvas, a portion of indras vajra . arjuna in return gave him the aagneya weapon, and asked him why they, though skilled in the vedas, had been censured by him. he replied that it was because they were without fires, without sacriflces, and without a brahman walking before them. the yakskas, raakshasas, gandharvas, pishaacas, uragas, and daanavas know the history of the kuru race have heard from naarada and other devarshis the deeds of your ancestors. have been vanquished by thee in battle on account of the brahmacarya being rigidly observed a kshattriya, who is addicted to lust, if he fights in the night, can never escape with life but even if addicted to lust, he who has a purohita may vanquish all wanderers of the night. therefore, o taapatya kings should always select a fit purohita . citraratha related tapatyupaakhyaana . vaasishtha . aurvopaakhyaana . vasishtopaakhyaana . dhaumya purohitakarana .

the discourse between cyavana and kushika. c bhishma said cyavana bhaargava saw the stain that would affect his own race and desired to consume the race of the kushikas he came and said to king kushika that he desired to dwell with him for some time. kushika and his wife welcomed and honoured him according to his desire, they promised to serve him, while he observed a vow. once he slept for twenty one days, while kushika and the queen kept themselves awake, foregoing all food then cyavana went out, followed by the king and the queen, and disappeared the king with the queen sorrowfully returned to the palace, where he found cyavana stretched as before on his bed, and sat by his side, while he slept for twenty one days then cyavana ordered them to rub him, and then entered the bathing house, and once more disappeared by means of his yoga power. the next time, c. was seen on the throne then he ordered food, but reduced it all to ashes, and disappeared. kushika with his queen stood there in the same posture the whole night without speaking a word, without giving way to wrath. so it went on every day. cyavana failed to notice any fault in the conduct of the king. then he ordered them to yoke themselves to a chariot and pull him along it should be the kings battle chariot with every weapon, etc and the goad they must drag him slowly in the sight of the people, who lamented suddenly he struck them with the goad, so that they were covered with blood no food had passed their lips for fifty nights on his way he began to give away very largely of the kings property. then cyavana, delighted, came n from the chariot, unharnessed the royal couple, and granted them a boon he softly touched them with his hands, the healing virtues of which were like ambrosia, and all their fatigue, etc was dispelled, and they once more became endued with youth. he dismissed them till the next himself remaining on the banks of the gangaa. meanwhile cyavana, by his yoga power, converted that delightful wood on the bank of the gangaa into a retreat full of wealth of every kind and jewels and gems . the next morning kushika came with his wife, and saw that palace made entirely of gold, etc and aps. and g and thought that it was the country of the uttara kurus or indras abode amaraavati. cyavana lay stretched on a costly and excellent bed, and at the same time on a mat of kusha grass. in a moment everything disappeared, aps g etc. cyavana praised kushika and his queen kushika said that he had a sufficient boon, not having been consumed by the fire of cyavanas penances he asked him to expound some bts . asked by kushika, cyavana explained the reason of his conduct in days past, when the gods had assembled together, he had heard brahmaan say that, owing to a contention between brahman and kshattriya energy, there would occur an intermixture in his race therefore he had resolved to exterminate the kushikas, but had failed to find any fault with kushika seeing the delightful palace he had created, kushika had had a foretaste of heaven and had become desirous of the status of a brahman and the merit of penances the person who will be the third in descent from thee shall attain to the status of a brahman through the energy of the bhrigus, thy grandson will be an ascetic endued with the splenr of fire shall set out on a tirthayaatraa. kushika asked in what way the status of brahmanhood would attach to his race . cyavana foretold that the kshattriyas would exterminate the bhaargavas, except urva, who would cast the fire of his wrath into the mares mouth in the ocean he would have a son ricika, to whom dhanurveda in its incarnate form would come in order to exterminate all kshattriyas he would communicate it to his son jamadagni kushika gaadhi urva vishvaamitra ricika jamadagni raama kushika became filled with joy cyavana set out on his tirtha yaatraa everything fell out as cyavana had said .

shukaabhipatana, . hearing the words of naarada, shuka understood that great misery follows the acquisition of children and wives, and that one has to undergo great labour in order to acquire science and vedic lore. he resolved to attain to the highest end, that is fraught with the greatest felicity, and whence there is no return into the ocean of births that cannot be attained without yoga shall therefore have recourse to yoga, and throwing off this body shall become transformed into wind and enter the sun for he s not wane like the moon with the gods when after death one enters the moon he falls to earth and thence ascends to heaven with the great rishis shall enter the energy of the sun declare before all the creatures... earth, ... daa g psh u raa and r that shall enter all creatures in the world. obtaining naaradas per mission, shuka went to vyaasa, who asked him to stay there for the day that he might behold him for some time. but shuka, only intent on emancipation, immediately left him and proceeded to kailaasa, which was inhabited by crowds of ascetics . having reached the summit of kailaasa, shuka set himself to practise yoga . having then obtained the permission of naarada, he soared into the skies and identified himself with the element of wind aps g r etc wondered. shuka proceeded in silence, his face turned towards the east, regarding the sun then to the malaya mountain urvashi and purvacitti, who always dwell on malaya, wondered. shuka asked the gods, etc to return his father an answer from him, if he should repeatedly call on him . shuka freed himself of the four kinds of faults, the eight kinds of tamas, the five kinds of rajas, the attribute of sattva, and then dwelt in braahman. meteors began to shoot, etc. indra poured showers of rain himavat and meru, each yojanas in height and breadth, were in close contact with each other. journeying towards the north, shuka clashed against them, and they were immediately broken in two. he was aed by g r y raa and vidyaadharas. he saw from a high region the celestial stream mandaakini running below, with many aps. beholding shuka, who was bodyless, those unclad aërial beings felt no shame. vyaasa followed behind him on the same aërial path, by means of high yoga. shuka, above the region of the wind, identified himself with braahman. ri. represented to vyaasa the achievements of his son. he indulged in lamentations shuka, who had entered the universe, had become the soul of everything, and had acquired omnipresence, answered by uttering bho in the form of an echo, and the entire universe echoed the answer of shuka from that time mountain caves and mountain sides still echo sounds uttered there. having cast off all the attributes of sound, etc and showing his yoga prowess in the manner of his disappearance, shuka in this way attained to the highest station. vyaasa sat n and began to think of his son with grief the aps. who were sporting on the banks of the celestial stream mandaakini saw him seated there, and all became agitated with shame. shiva, with g and great ri came and comforted vyaasa, who by the favour of shiva thenceforward always beheld a sha of his son by his side. this naarada and vyaasa repeatedly told me in days of yore .
shukakriti . bhishma said to yudhishthira vyaasa desired shuka to study the mokshadharma shuka mastered all the treatises on yoga, as also the science promulgated by kapila. then vyaasa caused him to go to janaka, the king of mithilaa, and not to the skies nor should he think himself superior to janaka, though he was only his yaajya. crossing the varshas of meru and hari and himavat, shuka came to bhaaratavarsha. having seen many countries inhabited by cinas and hunas, he reached aaryaavarta, and at last the country of the videhas, protected by janaka, and then mithilaa. he had not been fatigued on the way. he obtained permission to enter the city, but was at first roughly forbidden to enter the palace. at last he was admitted into the first chamber thence he was led into the second chamber by the minister, and thence into a garden that was like a second caitraratha, with damsels equal to the aps who entertained shuka and gave him to eat he, however, went unaffected through his rites, and in the first part of the night he devoted himself to yoga . the next morning he was received by janaka, and was instructed by him about moksha and the duties of a brahman ordinarily the purified understanding necessary for attaining moksha cannot be obtained without passing through all four stages of religious life but he who in the course of many births has obtained a pure mind, may attain to moksha even in the very first stage, and then there is no need for the three other stages, quoting a saying of king yayaati through the favour of thy father have acquired to omniscience thy knowledge is much greater than what you think it to be .
shukakritya . bhishma said to yudhishthira having heard the words of janaka, having entered soul by soul and having seen self by his self, shuka without putting further questions to janaka, proceeded northwards to shaishira . at that time naarada proceeded to himavat . then shuka came to the asylum of vyaasa. one day the disciples asked vyaasa to let no sixth disciple be skilled in the veda. vyaasa answered that they ought to multiply, and the veda to be spread, and taught them the qualifications of persons that can be accepted as disciples, and the rules in respect of the study of the veda . the disciples of vyaasa took leave of him and descended from the mountain to the earth for the purpose of subdividing the vedas there they performed the agnishtoma, etc at the sacrifices of brahmans, kshattriyas, and vaishyas, and taught the veda. vyaasa remained with shuka, passing his days in anxious thoughtfulness. naarada came and asked him why vedic sounds were silent now, so that the mountain now resembled a hamlet of nishaadas, and ri and g. did no longer shine as before and exhorted vyaasa to recite the veda and thereby dispel the fears arising from raa. vyaasa and shuka then set themselves to recite the veda. one day a violent wind arose which vyaasa declared to be an omen that the recitation of the veda should be suspended and he explained the devayaana and the pitriyaana, and the winds, especially pravaha, aavaha, udvaha, samvaha, vivaha, parivaha, paraavaha this wind is the breath of vishnus nostrils. having said this vyaasa plunged into the celestial ganges.
shuka naarada samvaada . bhishma said to yudhishthira naarada then came to shuka for the object of asking shuka the meaning of certain portions of the veda. naarada related what sanatkumaara had said in days of yore to certain rishis about avoiding attachment, etc in order to attain to final emancipation with the aid of such instructions the deities succeeded in leaving the earth and became the denizens of heaven.

shukotpatti . questioned by yudhishthira about shuka, whose mind became bent on braahman when he was a mere boy, bhishma answered the ri. did not make merit depend upon age, etc but upon the study of the vedas and upon tapas the merit of, horse sacrifices or vaajapeyas cannot come up to even of the merit that arises from yoga. once on the summit of meru, mahaadeva sported with his followers and paarvati, while vyaasa, devoted to yoga and dhaaranaa, practised austerities for years for the sake of obtaining a son, subsisting on air alone, aing mahaadeva. thither went ri b. ri lp s aa r surya, candramas, indra, m the oceans, the rivers, a g naarada, parvata, vishvaavasu, si and aps. this has been told to me by maarkandeya. shiva granted him that he would have a son like to fire, wind, earth, water, and space, and devoted to braahman . vyaasa was one day employed in rubbing his sticks to make a fire, when he beheld the aps. ghritaaci, and fell in love with her. when she approached, transformed into a she parrot, he dropped his seed, which became a son, who, from this circumstance, came to be called by the name of shuka. gangaa came and bathed him in her waters g. sung, and aps. danced, etc. vishvaavasu, tumburu, naa haahaa, and huhu eulogized the birth of shuka there came lp. with shakra, . ri and b. ri. maaruta showered celestial flowers shiva, together with paarvati, invested shuka with the sacred thread shakra gave him a celestial kamandalu and celestial robes, etc. as soon as shuka was born, the vedas, including the mysteries and abstracts, came to dwell in him, just as they dwelt in his father. shuka selected brihaspati for his pre ceptor, remembering the universal practice. having studied the vedas, the tradition, and the state policy, shuka returned home, after paying his pre ceptor the tuition fee. ating the vow of a brahmacaarin he practised the hardest penances, even in his childhood. taking no pleasure in the three modes of life, he only kept in view the law of emancipation .

. while duryodhana, dushaasana, karna, and shakuni were longing to harm the paandavas, durvaasas arrived with, disciples, and harassed duryodhana with his whimsical and insolent behaviour but as duryodhana was neither angered nor annoyed, he granted him a boon. according to what had been agreed upon between himself and karna and dushaasana, duryodhana asked durvaasas to visit the paandavas with his disciples, when draupadi, after having regaled the brahmans, etc with food, would have gone to rest. durvaasas promised to so . then durvaasas one day came to the paandavas with, disciples, when the meal was over and krishnaa was reposing. krishnaa then praised krishna, who, leaving rukmini, who was sleeping by his side, came to her and demanded something to eat. draupadi became embarrassed, because the sun given vessel only remained full till she had finished her meal, and therefore now was empty. at the request of krishna she, however, fetched the vessel, and krishna found a particle of rice and vegetable sticking at its rim, and swallowing it he said to her may it please the god who is the soul of the universe, and may the partaker of sacrifices be satisfied. then he ordered bhima to invite the munis to dinner. meanwhile those ascetics, having bathed in the river, observed that their stomachs were full, and as durvaasas feared that the paandavas would destroy them, looking n upon them with angry eyes, because the repast had been uselessly prepared for them, they all ran away, so that bhima sought for them in vain. as the paandavas were afraid that the munis might return at night and curse them, krishna suddenly appeared and consoled them. then he repaired to his capital . one day when the paandavas had gone a hunting, leaving draupadi in the hermitage with the permission of the great rishi trinabindu and of dhaumya, the king of sindhu, jayadratha vaarddhakshattri, who, with a view of matrimony, was on his way to the king of the shaalveyas, halted in the wood of kaamyaka, and seeing draupadi standing at the threshold of the hermitage, he fell in love with her, and sent king kotikaasya to inquire who she was . kotikaasya introduced himself to draupadi and showed her the trigarta king kshemankara, and the son of the king of the kulindas, and the son of subala of the race of ikshvaaku he said that jayadratha was there at the head of, chariots, etc followed by twelve sauvira princes as his standard bearers, and his brothers . draupadi told kotikaasya who she was, and that her husbands were out a hunting, and invited them to alight and await the return of the paandavas . kotikaasya told jayadratha the words of draupadi, and exhorted him to take her with him to the sauviras. jayadratha introduced himself to draupadi, who offered him water for washing his feet, and promised him fifty animals for breakfast and various kinds of deer, etc etc when yudhishthira returned. jayadratha asked her to leave the miserable paandavas and become his wife, but was severely rebuked by draupadi, who threatened him with the paandavas. as jayadratha said, we too belong by birth to the seventeen high clans, and look n upon the paandavas, she threatened him with krishna and arjuna, and the andhakas, vrishnis, and kaikeyas, and called upon dhaumya. jayadratha seized her by her upper garment draupadi pushed him so that he fell upon the ground but at last she was obliged to ascend his chariot, while dhaumya followed amidst jayadrathas infantry . when the paandavas again met, yudhishthira knew from the shrill cries of the birds that the forest had been invaded by hostile intruders, and he caused them to give up the chase and drive home on their great chariots drawn by saindhava horses. a yellow jackal on their left indicated the violence e. indrasena learned what had happened from the weeping foster sister of draupadi, and then they pursued and overtook jayadratha, who was greatly alarmed . draupadi, asked by jayadratha, pointed out to him each of the five paandavas, and advised him to throw n his arms and seek the protection of yudhishthira, at the top of whose flagstaff two tabours called nanda and upananda are constantly played. the paandavas, leaving the panic stricken infantry alone, rushed upon the charioteers . bhima with his iron mace, embossed with gold, rushed towards jayadratha, who was defended by kotikaasya. the trigarta king, who had killed the four steeds of yudhishthira with his mace, was himself killed by yudhishthira, who then, together with indrasena, mounted the chariot of sahadeva. nakula killed kshemankara and mahaamukha, and was compelled by the trigarta king suratha to mount bhimas chariot. bhima put kotikaasya to flight and slew him. arjuna killed the twelve sauvira heroes, etc. jayadratha put draupadi n and fled. yudhishthira, seeing draupadi and dhaumya walking in front, caused her to be taken up on the chariot of sahadeva. arjuna advised bhima to refrain from slaying the remnant of the saindhava host. bhima prevailed upon yudhishthira to return to the hermitage with the twins and draupadi and dhaumya, while he himself would find out and slay jayadratha. yudhishthira entreated him not to slay him, remembering dushalaa and gaandhaari but draupadi indignantly required that he should be slain, and bhima and arjuna went in search of him. in the hermitage yudhishthira found maarkandeya and many other brahmans and ascetics, who were greatly bewailing the lot of draupadi. meanwhile arjuna killed the horses of jayadratha, though they were a full krosha ahead of him. jayadratha was then overtaken by bhima, but arjuna entreated bhima not to kill him .

. while they were conversing in the evening, filled with sorrow, krishnaa, who wondered at the hardheartedness of duryodhana, karna, shakuni, and dushaasana, who were the only four that did not shed tears at their being exiled, and who lamented their present state so different from their former happiness, tried to excite yudhishthira to revenge himself . draupadi related the old story of the conversation between prahlaada and his grandson bali vairocana, in which prahlaada told bali that neither might nor forgiveness is invariably meritorious, and then she said therefore consider, o king that time has come for thee to put forth thy might . yudhishthira maintained that a wise man should ever forgive his persecutor that wrath has been given to man for the destruction of the world and cited gaathaas of the forgiving kaashyapa forgiveness is virtue, sacrifice, the vedas, etc. men of forgiveness obtain regions in the brahmaloka when one forgives everything, then he becomes braahman this and the other world belongs to him who forgives, etc. . from the fact that pious persons are often unhappy and vicious persons happy, draupadi concludes that dhaatri and vidhaatri have clouded yudhishthiras senses, that it is folly to aspire to final emancipation, that the consequences of acts are inevitable, that god makes creatures to work as a wooden l is made to move its limbs by a wire puller, etc and causes them to destroy each other, that god s not behave towards his creatures like a father or mother, but like a vicious person either god is sinful, or might is the true cause of acts, and then those are to be pitied that have no might . yudhishthira censured krishnaa for her atheism, saying that one should not act virtuously from the desire of reaping fruits, but because it is ordained so by the veda, the ancient religion revealed by the rishis, and because it is the conduct of the good and wise neither should one bt virtue or religion nor censure god, by whose grace mortal man, by piety, acquires immortality. for though we may not see the results, being mysterious even to the gods, and the illusion of the gods is mysterious to us, yet virtue and vice are not fruitless, as may be seen from the examples of vyaasa, vasishtha, maitreya, naarada, lomasha, shuka, and other rishis, who by virtue have become superior even to the gods as also from her own and dhrishtadyumnas birth nor would men have practised virtue, generation after generation, if asceticism, etc were useless, and no one would pursue salvation, but they would live like beasts, and why should rishis, gods, gandharvas, raakshasas, and asuras, who are above human conditions, cherish virtue he who, trusting the proofs of his own reasoning, rejects other authority or bts religion and virtue, loses this and yonder world, and is lower than even shudras and robbers . krishnaa said that she did not slander religion nor disregard god it was affliction that had extorted these words from her. she maintained that besides what a man obtains from necessity, fate, accident, and deeds in a former life, which god distributes, there are also things of which man himself is the cause, working through his own intelligence and exertion. it is by exertion that all creatures live, even dhaatri and vidhaatri, as well as the crane on the water. those who believe only in destiny or necessity are both the meanest among men. on the other hand, if god were not the giver of good and bad fruits, there would not be any creature that was miserable, and all exertions would be successful. manu himself declares that a man should act and if he works, even if he be not successful, his debt is cancelled. having exerted thyself, thou wilt know what the fruit of thy exertions will be. the tiller tills the soil with the plough, and sows the seed thereon he then sits silent, for the clouds are now the cause and if no rain favours him, the tiller is without blame...if, however, no exertion is made, there can be no success...all this, uttered by brihaspati himself, a learned brahman said to my father and my brothers from them heard it . bhima tried to prevail upon yudhishthira that he should make war with the dhaarta raashtras, aided by the srinjayas and kaikeyas and krishna, maintaining that a man should practise virtue for the sake of gaining wealth, and acquire wealth for the sake of pleasure, but neither for its own sake that might and energy constitute the virtue of the kshatriya, and that deviation from the virtues of ones own order is never laudable that the asuras, though elder brothers in possession of power and abundance, were all vanquished by the gods through stratagem that as wealth should be spent by one who wishes to increase his wealth, just as seeds are scattered on the ground, thus a person who throws away a little of his virtue like seeds in order to gain a larger measure of virtue is regarded as wise, and that whatever sin a monarch commits in acquiring inion, he cancels it all afterwards by sacrifices and by bestowing villages, etc on brahmans . yudhishthira declared that he was unable to violate the pledge, and that it was now too late for bhima to use harsh words . bhima said that only he whose life is unlimited, or who knows what the period of his life is, has time to wait they ought to strive for the possession of the king before they died if a man, slaying his injurer, goes the very day into hell, that hell becomes heaven to him the pain one feels in having to suppress his wrath is more burning than fire itself...thou art kind like a brahman, how hast thou been born in the kshatriya order those who are born in this order are generally of cruel hearts thou hast heard the duties of kings, as promulgated by manu, cruel and fraught with crookedness and opposed to tranquillity moreover, we will not be able to live unknown, as we are known all over the world, and many kings, who have been expelled by us from their kings, and robbed and exiled by us, will assist duryodhana and set against us numerous spies in disguise we have now lived in the woods for thirteen months, which may be regarded as so many years, as putikas are a substitute for the soma or one may free himself from this sin by offering food to a bull .

adding indistinctly the word elephant before this yudhi shthiras chariot had stayed at a height of four fingers breadth from the surface of the earth after this untruth his animals touched the earth.

. karna proposed to duryodhana that he should celebrate a raajasuya sacrifice like yudhishthira. but as the purohita told him that so long as yudhishthira and dhritaraashtra were living he could not undertake the raajasuya sacrifice, and advised him to cause the tributary kings to pay him tribute in gold, and with that gold to make a plough, and to plough the sacrificial compound with it, and then to perform a vaishnava sacrifice that nobody had performed before save the ancient vishnu which was equal to the raajasuya, this plan was agreed upon. duryodhana appointed persons to their respective tasks, and desired all the artisans to construct the plough, etc. . when vidura had announced to dhritaraashtra that the preparations had been made, messengers were dispatched to invite the princes and the brahmans. dushaasana ordered one messenger to invite the paandavas, but yudhishthira replied that they could not come before the com pletion of the thirteenth year. bhima threatened the other paandavas said nothing unpleasant. vidura was charged with the distribution of food to the guests. after the completion of the sacrifice, all the kings having been dismissed, duryodhana, with his brothers and karna and shakuni, entered haastinapura . duryodhana was praised by most of the citizens, and his friends compared him to yayaati, nahusha, maandhaatri, and bharata, who had gone to heaven after celebrating this sacrifice . karna said that when duryodhana had slain the paandavas in battle and completed the raajasuya sacrifice he would once more honour him thus, and promised that until he had slain arjuna he would not allow his feet to be washed, nor taste meat, and he would observe the asura vow, and never refuse to give to whoever might solicit him.

dvaitavanapravesha . the paandavas, with krishna and dhaumya, on costly chariots yoked with excellent steeds, went into the forest, distributing nishkas of gold, etc to brahmans versed in shikshaa, akshara, and mantras, and followed by twenty attendants with bows, etc while indrasena, with the princesss clothes and ornaments and the nurses and maidservants, followed in a chariot. the citizens walked round yudhishthira, and the brahmans and principal men of kurujaangala of all castes saluted him and blamed the dhaartaraashtras, etc. arjuna told them that after their exile they would take away the good name of their enemies, and asked them to beseech the ascetics for their good. at last they returned to their respective abodes . after a conference between yudhishthira and arjuna, they resolved upon dwelling for these twelve years at the sacred lake dvaitavana in the forest of the same name, on the banks of bhogavati, surrounded by many brahmans, and saluted by hosts of caaranas and siddhas, who came to see yudhi shthira . while they were dwelling there, dhaumya performed their ishtis and offerings to the pitris, etc. once the old rishi maarkandeya came to them and smiled, recollecting raama daasharathi, whom he had seen on the top of the rishyamuka, and comforted yudhishthira by reminding him of the aforesaid raama, naabhaaga, bhagiratha, etc and alarka, the king of the kaashis and the karushas, the seven rishis, who had followed the ordinance of the creator and therefore blazed in the firmament so you will regain prosperity. then he went away in a northerly direction . the dvaitavana forest becoming filled with brahmans, and always resounding with vedic recitations, mingling with the twangs of the bows of the paandavas, a beautiful union of brahman and kshatriya customs was produced. therefore one evening the rishi baka daalbhya represented to yudhishthira that the kshatriya should always consult with a brahman, as did the asura king bali, the son of virocana, who went to no other tirtha than the brahmans, and then had all his wishes gratified, but who met with destruction when he began to act unjustly towards them. then all those brahmans, dvaipaayana, naarada, jaamadagnya, etc praised yudhishthira .

dyutaparvan . when vyaasa with his disciples came to take leave, yudhishthira asked him about the celestial, atmospherical, and terrestrial portents which, according to the statement of naarada, had happened at the raajasuya. vyaasa said that in thirteen years they would be fulfilled by the destruction of all the kshatriyas, and that yudhishthira would that very night see shiva gazing incessantly towards the direction presided over by the king of the pitris . then vyaasa with his disciples proceeded towards kailaasa. yudhishthira resolved to die in order that he might not be the cause of the destruction of the kshatriyas, but called back from his intention by phaalguna, he took upon him the vow not to speak a harsh word to his brothers or to any of the kings. then, having gratified the pitris and gods, he entered his own palace, accompanied by his ministers . duryodhana, accompanied by shakuni, by and by beheld all the sabhaa he mistook a piece of crystal for water and drew off his clothes, mistook a lake for land and fell in, etc and was laughed at by bhima, arjuna, the twins, and the menials of the palace. filled with wrath and jealousy he became pale, and returned to haastinapura, together with shakuni . shakuni told him to ask yudhishthira, who was very fond of gambling and did not know how to play, to play at dice then he, who was skilled in dice, would win his king and prosperity for duryodhana . shakuni told dhritaraashtra that duryo dhana was pale and depressed dhritaraashtra asked duryodhana the cause duryodhana told him that yudhishthira supported, snaatakas, giving to each of them thirty slave girls that, other brahmans daily ate at his palace the best food off golden plates that the king of kaamboja sent to him innumerable skins, etc. that the ocean brought the vaaruna nectar to him in a vessel of copper, as the celestial wives to indra that vaasudeva, having brought an excellent conch, bathed him with sea water brought in, jars of gold, etc from the eastern, southern, and western oceans that the conches, which were blown when, brahmans were fed, could be heard there almost incessantly, etc. duryodhana proposed to dhritaraashtra to invite yudhi shthira to a game at dice with shakuni, and prevented him from consulting vidura till he had had a sabhaa built. then he ordered vidura, who dissuaded him in vain, to invite yudhishthira. vidura in great sorrow went to bhishma . at the request of janamejaya, vaishampaayana related that dhritaraashtra, having ascertained the opinion of vidura, sought to bring duryodhana back from his purpose to play at dice but duryodhana would not give way, relating that the nipas, citrakas, the kaukuras, the kaaraskaras, and the lohajanghas were like bondsmen in the house of yudhi shthira, and that bhima, arjuna, and draupadi had laughed at his mistake regarding the crystal, etc. . duryodhana enumerated to dhritaraashtra the articles brought as tribute from various peoples to yudhishthira. yaajnaseni daily took care that everybody, including the deformed and the dwarfs, had eaten before she herself took her meal. only two peoples did not pay tribute to yudhishthira, the paancaalas, in consequence of their relationship by marriage, and the andhaka vrishnis, in consequence of their friendship . duryo dhana continued to enumerate kings, etc who waited upon yudhishthira at the raajasuya. the ocean brought that vaaruna conch, which vishvakarman had constructed with, nishkas, and which prajaapati had in a former kalpa presented to indra with that conch krishna anointed yudhishthira. when the conches were blown, those among the kings who were weak fell n, and dhrishtadyumna, saatyaki, the paandavas, and keshava laughed then bibhatsu gave to the principal brahmans bullocks with horns plated with gold, and yudhishthira obtained, like harishcandra, such properity that he surpassed rantideva, naabhaaga, yauvanaashva, manu, prithu vainya, bhagiratha, yayaati, and nahusha . continuation of the con versation between dhritaraashtra and duryodhana . as shakuni recommended the match of dice and praised his own dexterity in gambling, and duryodhana spoke reprovingly of vidura on account of his fondness for the paandavas, etc dhritaraashtra reluctantly caused the sabhaa to be built, with, columns aned with gold and lapis lazuli, a krosha in length and breadth, and then ordered vidura to bring yudhishthira and his brothers . vidura arrived at the palace of yudhishthira and invited him. yudhishthira, having learned that he should have to play with shakuni, vivimshati, citrasena, satyavrata, purumitra, and jaya, the most desperate and terrible gamblers, always depending upon deceit, was unwilling to come but as he had made the vow never to refuse when challenged, he set out for haastinapura the next day with his relatives, draupadi, brahmans, etc riding on the chariot taken charge of by baahlika, and when he had arrived he saluted bhishma, drona, karna, kripa, ashvatthaaman, somadatta, duryodhana, shalya, saubala, dushaasana, jayadratha, etc and gaandhaari and dhritaraashtra . shakuni exhorted yudhishthira to gamble. yudhi shthira quoted asita devala, but he was obliged to assent duryodhana said that he himself would supply jewels, etc and that it was for him that shakuni would play . the play began, the stake being a wreath of pearls, which shakuni won . shakuni then won from yudhishthira his treasury, slave girls, serving men, elephants, chariots, the gandharva horses which citrasena had given to arjuna, his warriors, and nidhis . vidura, addressing dhrita raashtria, quoted the words of kaavya, and reminded him that among the bhojas they had abaned an unworthy son the andhakas, yaadavas, and bhojas had abaned kamsa, and when he had been slain by krishna the whole tribe became glad for a hundred years let arjuna slay this suyodhana at thy command he quoted what kaavya said to the asuras in order to induce them to aban jambha, and related how a king from greediness after gold killed some gold vomiting fowls that dwelt in his house, and so destroyed both his present and future wealth . vidura warned against the gambling, and suggested to dhritaraashtra rather to win the paandavas than their wealth, and to let shakuni, the hill king, return whence he came . duryodhana blamed vidura for his partiality towards the paandavas, and said that he would only follow the advice of his own intellect. vidura complained of the ingratitude of kings and their fondness of flattery . yudhishthira lost his wealth, kine, horses, goats, and sheep, from parnaashaa to the eastern bank of the sindhu, his city, country, lands, and the wealth of all dwelling therein, except that of the brahmans, and all those persons themselves except the brahmans, the ear rings and nishkas and other ornaments of the princes who were present, then nakula, sahadeva, arjuna, bhima, himself, and draupadi now bhishma, drona, kripa, vidura, etc all gave way to grief, but dhritaraashtra, karna, dushaasana, etc were glad . duryodhana ordered kshattri to bring hither draupadi to sweep the chambers and stay with the servant maids vidura declared that having lost himself, yudhishthira could not lawfully stake draupadi, and said a goat had once swallowed a knife, and when it was pierced by it the hunter placed the head of the animal on the ground, and when drawing the knife out he tore its throat frightfully therefore not swallow the wealth of the paandavas . then duryodhana ordered the praa tikaamin to bring draupadi she ordered him to ask yudhishthira whether he had lost himself or her first as yudhishthira said nothing, duryodhana ordered that draupadi should come and put her question in the assembly she sent the suta back to the assembly saying that she would what aged and virtuous persons would tell her all sat without uttering a word but yudhishthira sent a trusted messenger to draupadi, directing that, although in consequence of her season having come she was attired in one piece of cloth only. she should come before her father in law weeping bitterly. duryodhana again ordered the praatikaamin to bring her, and as he seemed irresolute, he asked dushaasana to so. as she would flee to the ladies household, dushaasana dragged her in by her hair, while she was praying to krishna and jishnu, who were naaraayana and nara, and blaming drona, bhishma, vidura, etc for looking silently on this crime. as she was casting a glance upon her enraged lords, dushaasana, dragging her still more forcibly, addressed her, slave slave and laughed aloud, applauded by karna, shakuni, and duryodhana, while all the others were filled with sorrow. bhishma declared himself to be unable to decide the question she had put. as she then asked the others present to decide it, dushaasana spoke many harsh words, and bhima, looking at yudhishthira, gave way to wrath . bhima blamed yudhishthira, and ordered sahadeva to bring fire, as he wanted to burn the hands of yudhishthira, but arjuna appeased him. vikarna repeatedly appealed to those present to decide the question, and as they did not say one word, he declared that as yudhishthira must be regarded as of no authority, because he had shown himself addicted to the vice of gambling, etc he regarded draupadi as not won. all applauded him, except karna, who maintained that she had been justly won, and as, contrary to the ordinance of the gods that a woman should have only one husband, she had five husbands, there was no impropriety in dragging her to the assembly, and even to uncover her. karna then asked dushaasana to take off the robes of the paandavas and the attire of draupadi. the paandavas took off their upper garments, and dushaasana began to drag off the attire of draupadi. but as she thought of and cried to hari, dharma continually covered her anew with excellent clothes. bhima swore that he would drink the blood of dushaasana. all blamed dushaasana and dhritaraashtra. vidura exhorted the assembly to answer the question put by draupadi, and related the dialogue of prahlaada and aangirasa . v. prahlaada. the kings answered not a word, and karna told dushaasana to take away the slave woman krishnaa to the inner apartments . dragged by dushaasana, draupadi saluted the assembly, complained of being exposed to the gaze of the crowd, and again asked them to answer her question. bhishma again declared himself unable to decide it, but thought yudhishthira ought to decide it . duryodhana said to draupadi let thy husbands decide the question, and, by making yudhishthira the just a liar, free thee from slavery. bhima said that only his obedience to yudhishthira and the admoni tions of arjuna retained him from killing the wretched sons of dhritaraashtra. bhishma, drona, and vidura asked him to forbear . karna exhorted draupadi to choose a new husband among the sons of dhritaraashtra, and duryodhana, after having exhorted yudhishthira to decide the question, uncovered his left thigh and showed it to draupadi. bhishma swore that he would break this thigh of his. vidura warned them, and was of opinion that yudhishthira had no right to stake her. duryodhana said that if bhima, arjuna, and the twins declared that yudhishthira was not their master, then draupadi should be free. arjuna said that he was certainly their master before the play, but having lost himself, let all the kauravas judge whose master he could be after that. just then a jackal began to cry near the agnihotra of dhrita raashtra, and other terrible omens were heard. on that account gaandhaari and vidura remonstrated with dhritaraashtra, who blamed duryodhana and granted a boon to krishnaa. she chose that yudhishthira should become free from slavery. as she was granted a second boon, she asked that bhima and his brothers with their chariots and bows should regain their liberty. she refused to ask a third boon . karna praised draupadi for having saved her husbands. bhima threatened to slay all his foes instantly, but was retained by arjuna and yudhishthira . dhritaraashtra sent yudhishthira with his brothers and krishnaa upon their chariots to indra prastha, having asked him not to remember the harshness of duryodhana .

the five paandavas he would remain king. duryodhana rose from the lake and challenged the paandavas yudhishthira taunted him with his unfair conduct in slaying abhimanyu . krishna reproved yudhi shthira for his rashness in staking everything on the result of such a single combat with duryodhana bhimasena assured krishna that duryodhana would be no match for him in an encounter with the mace

requested by janamejaya, vaishampaayana related how bala raama had determined upon and set out on a pilgrimage to the tirthas on the sarasvati, having let the sacred fire be brought from dvaarakaa and the priests, and having given away rich ations to every one who wished for them, accompanied by priests, friends, brahmans, chariots, elephants, steeds, and servants, visiting all the sacred places along her course. in the course of his wanderings he at last came to kurukshetra. requested by janamejaya, vaishampaayana related the baladevatirthayaatraa . requested by dhritaraashtra, sanjaya related beholding bala raama, duryodhana rejoiced. according to the proposal of bala raama, yudhishthira with his brothers and duryodhana proceeded westwards to samanta pancaka on the southern side of

earth, the srinjayas cried aloud, so also did the paandavas bhimasena then had his coat of mail fractured and was prostrated on the ground, but rose, steadying himself with great effort . arjuna inquired of krishna about the relative merits of the two combatants krishna said that their training had been equal, but bhima was superior in strength duryodhana was superior in skill and had had more practice by fighting fairly bhima would never succeed in winning, but by fighting unfairly he would surely be able to slay duryodhana, just as the asuras were vanquished by the gods, virocana and vritra by indra with the aid of deception bhima has vowed to break the thighs of duryo dhana with his mace let him accomplish that vow of his he censured yudhishthira for his folly, and quoted a verse uttered by ushanas duryodhana has practised with the mace for full thirteen years. arjuna struck his own left thigh before the eyes of bhimasena, who understood the sign. as duryodhana set his heart on the manœuvre called dvasthaana and jumped upwards, bhimasena hurled his mace at the thighs of duryodhana and fractured them. portents appeared showers of blood and showers of dust were poured by indra a loud noise was made by y raa and psh. the paancaalas and the paandavas were filled with anxiety g si and caa. went away . the paandavas and somakas rejoiced bhimasena rebuked duryo dhana, and

ashamed but krishna justified the use of unfair means for the slaughter of the kuru warriors . the paandava warriors proceeded to the kuru camp, which was entirely deserted krishna caused arjuna to take n the gaandiva and his inexhaustible quivers, and then to dismount then krishna also dismounted the celestial ape disappeared, and the chariot, with its steeds, etc was reduced to ashes. krishna congratulated yudhishthira on his victory, and yudhishthira attributed that victory to krishnas power . in the encampment of the kurus they found great wealth at krishnas suggestion the paandavas and saatyaki resolved to pass the night at a spot outside the camp, on the banks of the oghavati. they then dispatched krishna to haastinapura in order to pacify the wrath of gaandhaari, and to comfort her and dhritaraashtra. he set out with daaruka upon his chariot, yoked with shaibya and sugriva . asked by janamejaya, vaishampaayana said that the reason why yudhi shthira sent krishna to haastinapura was his fear that gaandhaari, by means of her ascetic merit, should reduce the paandavas to ashes, because duryodhana had been slain unfairly vyaasa will be there. krishna caused daaruka to equip his chariot, and quickly set out for haastinapura. he arrived at dhritaraashtras palace, where vyaasa had arrived before him he comforted dhritaraashtra and gaandhaari, who said that her heart had again become steady . then krishna came to know the evil that was meditated by ashvatthaaman, and suddenly took leave, requested by dhritaraashtra and gaandhaari to protect the paandavas, and proceeded with daaruka. vyaasa comforted dhritaraashtra. krishna arrived at the camp and informed the paandavas . requested by dhritaraashtra, sanjaya narrated the lamentations of duryodhana while

vishvaamitra cooked caru, but could not approach dharma before his guest had dined with the other hermits. dharma said, have already dined wait here, and went away. vishvaamitra, bearing that food on his head and himself subsisting on air, waited a hundred years, while the ascetic gaalava waited on him. then dharma accepted that food, which was still warm and fresh, and called vishvaamitra a viprarshi, whereby he became a brahman. gaalava repeatedly asked vishvaamitra to take a gift from him as his preceptor, and at last vishvaamitra, seeing his persistency, requested him to give white steeds each with one black ear . gaalava got troubled and was gradually reduced to a skeleton. he thought of repairing to vishnu, when his friend garuda came, and said he had spoken to vishnu in his

on beds of ranku skins and to be wakened by sutas and maagadhas, now slept on the bare ground he lamented the treatment he had permitted to be meted out to the paandavas, and feared lest they would avenge themselves arjuna, he thought, would not have left heaven, where he received the celestial weapons, if it were not for this purpose. this shakuni told to duryodhana, who was sitting with karna, and duryodhana was filled with grief . shakuni and karna proposed to duryodhana that they should go to dvaitavana to exult over the paandavas . duryodhana gladly approved the proposal, but feared that he might not obtain the permission of dhritaraashtra, who thought that the paandavas had become more powerful than before in consequence of their ascetic austerities. he asked them, with dushaasana, to find out some skilful pretext. the next morning karna and shakuni agreed with duryodhana that they should go there under the pretext of supervising their cattle stations . they then all saw dhrita raashtra. a cowherd, named samanga, who had been instructed beforehand, came to the king and spoke to him of the cattle. karna and shakuni asked him to give permission to duryodhana to go thither. dhritaraashtra suggested to send some faithful men, fearing some collision with the paandavas if they were to go thither themselves for though yudhishthira would not suffer his wrath to be awakened, bhima and draupadi were naturally passionate. shakuni promised that they would not go to the spot where the paandavas resided, and obtained the permission. duryodhana then started with karna, dushaasana, shakuni, etc and ladies by the thousand, followed by the citizens and their wives, with, chariots, etc and took up his quarters at the distance of a gavyuti from the lake of dvaitavana . having caused the calves to be marked, etc duryodhana, etc began to sport and go a hunting, and came to the lake. yudhishthira was then, together with draupadi, celebrating the diurnal raajarshi sacrifice according to the ceremonial used in the forest. when the attendants of duryodhana came to the banks of the lake to construct pleasure houses, they were forbidden to enter by a number of gandharvas, who told them that the king of the gandharvas had come from the abode of kubera, with his followers and several hosts of apsarases, etc and when duryodhana sent a number of his warriors, they also were prevailed upon by the gandharvas to return . a battle ensued between the soldiers of duryodhana and the gandharvas, headed by their king citrasena the soldiers of duryodhana fled, except karna, who killed hundreds of gandharvas. duryodhana, shakuni, dushaasana, and vikarna returned to assist karna, and the battle was renewed. citrasena made use of illusion it seemed as if every warrior of the kuru army were surrounded by ten gandharvas. the entire army of duryodhana again fled, except karna. the gandharvas then destroyed the chariot of karna, who, mounting the chariot of vikarna, was forced to drive away . duryodhana refused to fly, but the gandharvas destroyed his chariot and slew his charioteer and horses thereupon citrasena took him prisoner, and dushaasana, who was seated on his chariot, and citrasena, vivimshati, vinda, and anuvinda, and the royal ladies, were taken by other gandharvas, . the flying soldiers and ministers of duryodhana took refuge with yudhishthira . yudhishthira, saying that the honour of the family was being destroyed by the gandharvas seizing duryodhana, etc in their presence, prevailed upon his brother to rescue duryodhana, etc if possible, by conciliation or lightly skirmishing, otherwise by all means, yudhishthira being prohibited from partaking in the combat by his sacrifice. arjuna promised to rescue duryodhana or kill the king of the gandharvas . the four paandavas, cased in mail and riding in chariots drawn by fleet horses, encountered the gandharvas as these would not set duryodhana, etc free, as requested by arjuna, a fierce battle ensued . the gandharvas, in vain, attempted to break the chariots of the paandavas especially arjuna, by means of his aagneya weapon, sent millions of them to the abode of yama. the gandharvas then rose up to the skies, taking the dhaartaraashtras with them, and showering maces, darts, etc upon arjuna, who killed them with his weapons sthulaakarna, indrajaala, saura, aagneya, and saumya. at last citrasena rushed at arjuna, armed with a mace of iron as arjuna cut that mace in seven pieces with his arrows, citrasena, by means of his science, concealed himself from the view of arjuna, and thus continued to fight with him but arjuna destroyed his power of concealing himself by shooting at him with his celestial arms guided by the sound . then citrasena showed himself to arjuna, reminding him of his being his friend, and there was put an end to the battle . citrasena related to arjuna that, staying in his abode, he had become acquainted with the purpose of duryodhana, etc and had been requested by indra to bring duryodhana thither in chains together with his counsellors. arjuna entreated him to set duryodhana free, but, at the request of citrasena, they left it to be decided by yudhishthira yudhishthira then liberated all the kauravas. the gandharvas went away with the apsarases, and indra revived the slain gandharvas by sprinkling amrita upon them. friendly admonished by yudhishthira, duryodhana, over whelmed with shame, returned to his capital . when duryodhana, afflicted with grief, was approaching haastinapura with his army, karna congratulated him on the honourable victory over the gandharvas . duryodhana told karna that, as the gandharvas had resorted to illusion and ascended the skies, he had been captured with his army, and that it was the paandavas who had vanquished the gandharvas . duryodhana continued his narrative and declared that he would stay there abstaining from food, and that the others, headed by dushaasana, should go to haastinapura. he then offered the royal power to dushaasana. dushaasana, his voice choked in tears, refused to accept it. karna reproached them for weeping thus, and declared that the paandavas, who resided in the inions of duryodhana and enjoyed happiness under his protection, only did their duty in liberating him . karna continued explaining his opinion, that those who resided in the kings realm should always exert themselves to the best of their ability for the king if the paandavas had not followed duryodhana to the battle it would have been an improper act on their part. duryodhana, firmly resolved to leave the world, desired not to rise from where he sat . shakuni reproached duryodhana for his foolish despair, saying that he ought rather to reward the paandavas by granting them their paternal king. duryodhana embraced dushaasana, but did not waver from his purpose he spread kusha grass on the earth, etc and began to pray and worship mentally. the daiteyas and daanavas who had formerly been vanquished by the gods and were dwelling in paataala, having ascertained duryodhanas purpose, commenced a sacrifice with formulas, revealed by brihaspati and ushanas, according to the rites indicated in the atharvaveda and the upanishad, assisted by brahmans of rigid vows, well versed in the vedas and the vedaangas. after these rites were ended a sorceress arose, whom the daityas caused to bring duryodhana to them in the night . the daanavas said to him do not such a rash act as the vow of starvation. the suicide ever sinks into hell, and is blamed...in days of old we had obtained thee by ascetic austerities from maheshvara the upper part of thy body is wholly made of vajras, and is, therefore, invulnerable to weapons of every description the lower part of thy body was made of flowers by devi herself ...brave kshatriyas, headed by bhagadatta, will slay thy foes...in order to aid thee many daanavas have been born on earth. other asuras will also possess bhishma, drona, kripa, and others possessed by those asuras these heroes will aban their kindness and fight with thy foes...we have already settled the means of slaying arjuna the slain naraka has assumed the form of karna recollecting his former hostility he will encounter both keshava and arjuna, and vanquish arjuna in battle. indra in disguise will deprive karna of his earrings and coat of mail. we also have appointed innumerable daityas and raakshasas, the so called samshaptakas, who will slay arjuna...thou art ever our refuge, as the paandavas are the refuge of the gods. then the daanavas embraced and cheered him, and that very goddess carried him back to the spot where he had sat n intent upon putting an end to his life, and there she vanished. now duryodhana considered all as a dream, and thought he should defeat the paandavas in battle. and also karna, being possessed by the soul of naraka, and the samshaptakas, possessed by the raakshasas, were desirous of slaying arjuna and bhishma, drona, kripa, etc influenced by the daanavas, were not so affectionate towards the paandavas as they had been. duryodhana did not tell anyone of this. when the night had passed away karna again exhorted duryodhana, and promised to slay arjuna in battle. duryodhana arose and arranged his army, and went to haastinapura, accompanied by karna, shakuni, his brothers headed by dushaasana and bhurishravas, and somadatta, and baahlika . karnadigvijaya . duryodhanayajna . hearing the vow of karna, yudhishthira, filled with anxiety, made up his mind to aban dvaitavana. duryodhana with his brothers, and bhishma, drona, kripa, and karna ruled the earth justly and worshipped the brahmans by sacrifices and profuse gifts .

goharanaparvan . meanwhile the spies of duryodhana returned to haastinapura and informed duryodhana, who was sitting with drona, karna, kripa, bhishma, his brothers, and the trigartas, that they had not found out the paandavas, but that kicaka had been slain . kaarna and dushaasana proposed that the other spies should be sent . drona said people like the paandavas never perish, let the abode which the paandavas are to occupy now be settled . bhishma applauded drona . kripa recommended precautions . the trigarta king, susharman, supported by karna, proposed to invade the city of viraata and to rob his kine and wealth, and thus to take revenge for the invasions of the matsyas headed by kicaka. duryodhana caused dushaasana to array their forces. susharman set out towards the south east on the seventh day of the dark fortnight, and the kauravas on the eighth day . after kicaka had been slain, viraata began to rest his hopes on the paandavas. his brothers, shataanika and madiraaksha, and the king himself, and suryadatta and shankha, the eldest son of viraata, put on their coats of mail. viraata also caused shataanika to order chariots for kanka, vallava, tantripaala, and daamagranthi . the matsyas overtook the trigartas shortly before sunset. shataanika and vishaalaaksha penetrated into the heart of the trigarta host. viraata, with suryadatta in his van and madiraaksha in his rear, began a single combat from chariots against susharman . the night interrupted the battle for a while, but it began once more when the moon arose. susharman and his younger brother made viraata prisoner, and the matsyas began to fly bhima would uproot a tree, but was prevented by yudhishthira, lest the people should recognize them then bhima, with nakula and sahadeva as protectors of his wheels, rushed against susharman, and the matsya warriors, viraatas son, and yudhishthira, etc followed him the charioteer of susharman was dragged to the ground. madiraashva came to the aid of bhima. viraata leapt n from the chariot of susharman, seizing the mace of the latter, and ran in pursuit of him susharman was seized by bhima, but set free by yudhishthira . the paandavas passed the night on the field of battle honoured by viraata. as proposed by yudhishthira, viraata ordered messengers to proclaim the victory in the city. the messengers repaired to the city that very night, and at sunrise they proclaimed the victory at the city gates . meanwhile duryodhana, etc invaded the matsya country and took away the kine. hearing this, bhuminjaya, who had been left by the king in the empty city, and whose charioteer had been slain in a great battle, followed the advice of krishna and sent uttaraa, who prevailed upon brihannalaa to become the charioteer of uttara. uttaraa and her maidens asked arjuna to bring fine clothes for their ls when he had vanquished the kurus . seeing the host of the kurus, uttara became agitated with fear and jumped n from the chariot and began to flee, but was seized by arjuna and made to hold the reins, while arjuna had to fight . bhishma, drona, etc suspected the comer to be arjuna, and many portents were explained by drona in that sense. karna blamed drona, and duryodhana said that if it were arjuna the paandavas must go into exile for twelve more years . having reached the shami tree, arjuna ordered uttara to fetch the weapons of the paandavas, including gaandiva, which were deposited there . believing that a corpse had been tied up in the tree, uttara refused, but as arjuna said there are only bows in that tree and no corpse, he climbed up and unwrapped and untied the bows . arjuna explained to him to whom the different bows belonged, first mentioning the gaandiva, which is honoured by the gods, the daanavas, and the gandharvas . he then revealed to uttara that they were the paandavas and confirmed it by telling his ten names . arjuna took off the bracelets from his arms, etc recalled to his mind all his weapons, and twanged the gaandiva with a dreadful sound, whence the kurus knew that he was arjuna, then he comforted uttara by mentioning his former exploits and his preceptors in arms . having taken n the banner with the figure of a lion he set up his own flagstaff bearing the figure of an ape with a lions tail, which was a celestial illusion contrived by vishva karman himself, for as soon as he thought of the gift of agni, agni ordered the superhuman creatures to take their usual place on that banner, which then fell n from the air on his chariot . drona concluded from various omens that it was arjuna . duryodhana repeated to bhishma, drona, and kripa, his and karnas opinion, that arjuna must have broken his pledge, and asked bhishma to calculate the time. karna blamed drona for praising arjuna, and declared that he would throw arjuna n from his chariot that very day . kripa blamed karna and warned him from fighting alone with arjuna, mentioning his exploits they ought all to fight with arjuna and not karna alone . ashvatthaaman blamed karna for his vain boast and declared that he would not fight with arjuna . bhishma tried to mediate between ashvatthaaman and kripa on one side and karna on the other side he was of opinion that fight they must, and therefore this was not the time for quarrel. the braahmaastra and the vedas are never to be seen combined anywhere else than in drona . he was supported by ashvatthaaman and duryodhana. drona said let such arrangements be made that arjuna may not be able to approach duryodhana in battle, and that duryodhana may not be captured by the foe . having calculated the time, bhishma declared that the paandavas had not broken the pledge. duryodhana said will not give back the king to the paandavas. bhishma proposed that duryodhana should proceed towards the capital with one fourth of the army, and that one fourth should escort the kine, while he, drona, karna, ashvatthaaman, and kripa should withstand the foes. this proposal was accepted bhishma placed drona in the centre, ashvatthaaman on the left wing, kripa on the right wing, and karna in the van, and would himself stand in the rear . drona recognized the top of arjunas banner, etc. arjuna directed uttara to the spot where duryodhana was the soldiers became so con founded that they could not even fly, and the kine turned back along the southern road . as arjuna was advancing towards duryodhana the kurus fell upon him, especially karna, who was supported by citrasena, sangraa majit, shatrusaha, jaya, and vikarna vikarna fled shatruntapa and many others were slain by arjuna, so also sangraamajit at last karna took to flight . duryodhana, etc attacked arjuna arjuna shot at drona, dusaha, ashvatthaaman, dushaasana, and kripa, and wounded bhishma, duryodhana, and karna. then arjuna described to uttara the banners, etc of kripa, drona, ashvatthaaman, duryodhana, karna, and bhishma . indra, the gods, the vishvas, the ashvins, the maruts, the yakshas, the gandharvas, the mahoragas, the naagas, the raakshasas, the serpents, the pitris, and the maharshis came to see the combat, likewise, sitting on the chariot of indra, king vasumanas, etc. also agni, shiva, soma, varuna, prajaapati, dhaatri, vidhaatri, kubera, yama, alambusha, ugrasena, tumburu, etc came there . arjuna attacked kripa, announced his name, and blew the devadatta at last kripa was led away by his soldiers . drona attacked arjuna arjuna said will not strike thee unless thou strikest me first with his own weapons arjuna baffled the aindra, vaayavya, and aagneya weapons, which were shot by drona a voice was heard in the sky applauding drona then ashvatthaaman attacked arjuna, which gave drona an opportunity to leave the field . ashvatthaaman cut off the string of the gaandiva and was applauded by the gods, and by drona, bhishma, karna, and kripa. arjuna attached a fresh string to the gaandiva. as ashvatthaamans arrows became exhausted karna attacked arjuna, who challenged him to a single combat and rebuked him, because he had fled after the slaughter of his younger brother. at last karna, wounded, fled in a northern direction . then arjuna ordered uttara to take him to bhishma uttara became afraid and was comforted by arjuna, who enumerated some of his exploits and weapons. dushaasana, vikarna, dusaha, and vivimshati rushed towards arjuna dushaasana fled vikarna fell n dusaha and vivimshati were taken away by their warriors . at last the kauravas fled duryodhana, karna, and dushaasana attempted in vain to defeat arjuna . then bhishma and arjuna fought with the praajaapatya, aindra, aagneya, raudra, kaubera, vaaruna, yaamya, and vaayavya weapons the gandharva citrasena showed the two combatants to indra, who showered celestial flowers n upon them at last bhishma, wounded, lost consciousness and was led away by his charioteer . duryodhana and then vikarna attacked arjuna vikarna ran back and ascended the chariot of vivimshati duryodhana was wounded and fled, and so did all the warriors . stung by the censure of arjuna, duryodhana returned, and karna, bhishma, drona, kripa, vivimshati, and dushaasana rushed forwards to protect duryodhana. arjuna employed the weapon sammohana which he had obtained from indra, and blew his conch so that the kurus were deprived of their senses. then he caused uttara to take away the white garments of drona and kripa, the yellow ones of karna, and the blue ones of duryodhana and ashvatthaaman, but not those of bhishma, because he had not been stupefied. arjuna wounded bhishma, who told duryodhana to go back to his city, which they all did arjuna followed them for a while and worshipped bhishma, drona, ashvatthaaman, and kripa then he, with an arrow, broke the crown of duryodhana and blew the devadatta. then he ordered uttara to turn back. the gods returned to their respective abodes . a large number of kuru soldiers issuing from the forest stood before arjuna with joined palms and were spared. arjuna said to uttara do not eulogize the paandavas, but say that the feat is thy own. then he replaced the weapons on the shami tree the monkey ascended to the sky, together with the other creatures on the flagstaff, the illusion melted away, and uttaras own banner was replaced upon the chariot. arjuna entered the city in the guise of brihannalaa, having sent the cowherds to announce the victory . viraata entered his city, followed by the four paandavas, and dispatched an army to protect uttara, though yudhishthira said that, protected by brihannalaa, he was able to vanquish even the gods, the asuras, the siddhas, and the yakshas. meanwhile the messengers of uttara came and viraata ordered the highways to be decorated, etc and began to play at dice with yudhishthira, who again repeatedly praised brihannalaa. viraata struck yudhishthira with a die, but the blood was prevented from falling on the ground and was washed away by krishnaa, who also, at the injunction of yudhishthira, let uttara enter alone, that brihannalaa should not see him bleeding. uttara prevailed upon viraata to ask yudhishthiras par. when the bleeding had stopped, brihannalaa entered . uttara said all this has been accomplished by a devaputra who then disappeared. arjuna gave to uttaraa the garments he had brought .

. b bhishma related the young child of a brahman died and was taken to the burning place a vulture caused the lamenting kinsmen to leave the child, as the sun was soon to set, saying that the child could not be revived by their lingering. a jackal, black as a raven, rebuked them for not waiting till the sun had set, as the child might possibly revive. the vulture and the jackal alternately endeavoured to persuade them. the jackal mentioned that by raamas slaying the shudra named shambuka, a brahmana child was restored to life similarly the son of r. ri. shveta. the vulture said that if only rudra, etc would grant him a boon, the child might come back to life, and mentioned the spirits and y. and raa etc who haunt the burning place, while the jackal reminded them that it was here on this quiet and peaceful spot that the pitris by thousands took leave of the world. the jackal and the vulture continued to dispute, exhausted with hunger and thirst, wishing to get opportunity of devouring the child. then shankara exhorted by his consort came, and, taking up a quantity of water in his hands, restored the child to life for a hundred years, and to the jackal and the vulture he granted a boon, in consequence of which their hunger was appeased. blessing upon the reader .

on the wheel of life on the duties that men should observe on renunciation, knowledge, and power on the different conceptions of braahman it is impossible to attain to purusha by any other means than goodness some assert the unity of kshetrajna and sattva this is not correct the relation of purusha to sattva is like that of the gnat to the udumbara, or that of water drops on the leaf of a lotus. the ri. once more asked about the diversities of practice observed by men, and about the connection between the kshetrajna and sattva . brahmaan, quoting what was said by a preceptor to a disciple, said that abstention from harming any creature is the foremost of all duties, and the relation between sattva and kshetrajna is that of the object to the subject, or like that of the matter to the maker, or like that of a lamp to him who lights it sattva is manifest, while purusha is unmanifest knowledge is indispensable for attaining to felicity from pradhaana develops mahat, from mahat

. after some time yudhishthira taught arjuna in private the science that would reveal the whole universe to him, and told him to practise severe austerities bhishma, etc know the fourfold dhanur veda, the braahma weapon, etc. all celestial weapons are in the possession of indra, imparted to him by the celestials from fear of vritra. then arjuna took up the gaandiva, etc blessed by brahmans, siddhas, and invisible spirits, and by krishnaa, who wished him success from dhaatri, vidhaatri, hri, shri, kirti, dhriti, pushti, umaa, lakshmi, sarasvati, the vasus, rudras, aadityas, the hosts of the maruts, the vishvedevas, and the saadhyas, and wished him safety from the spirits of the sky, earth, and heaven, and all other enemies and having walked round his brothers and dhaumya, he set out towards the north. all creatures left the path of arjuna, who was urged by the desire of beholding indra . he passed over many mountains, and reached himavat in one day by means of his yoga then he passed over gandhamaadana, etc and reached indrakila, walking night and day untiringly. here he was addressed by a voice in the skies, and beheld indra in the guise of a brahman, who told him to throw away his bow as of no use there, as this was the abode only of peaceful brahmans, and advised him to wish for heavenly bliss but arjuna only asked for the celestial weapons, which indra said he should obtain when he had seen shiva . then indra disappeared, and arjuna remained, devoted to yoga .

. after the lokapaalas had gone away, arjuna began to think of the chariot of indra, which, guided by maatali, came n full of swords, missiles, maces, thunderbolts, etc and great naagas with fiery mouths, and drawn by, horses of golden hue, and with the flagstaff vaijayanta . maatali, descending, invited him to ascend the chariot, as indra waited to behold him, surrounded by gods, rishis, gandharvas, and apsarases. as that chariot cannot be obtained even by hundreds of raajasuyas and horse sacrifices, and as even gods and daanavas are not competent to ride in it, and as he that has no ascetic merit is not competent even to see or touch it, arjuna first let maatali ascend it and control the horses. then he purified himself in the gangaa, repeated his prayers, gratified the pitris, and bade farewell to the mandara mountain . then he ascended, in the chariot, through the sky and beheld thousands of vimaanas of extra ordinary beauty there was no sun or moon or fire, but they blazed in light of their own, generated by virtue and ascetic merit and the stars, which from earth look small in con sequence of their distance, but are very large, were seen by him in their places and raajarshis who had attained siddhi, and heroes fallen in battle, and those that had obtained heaven by tapas and gandharvas, and guhyakas, and rishis, and apsarases. maatali explained to him that the stars were virtuous persons stationed in their respective places . at the gates he beheld airaavata with four tusks equal to kailaasa. continuing along the path of the siddhas, he passed through the regions of kings, and thus passing through svargaloka he beheld amaraavati, the city of indra . when arjuna had entered the city, praised by apsarases, gandharvas, siddhas, great rishis, and gods, he, at the request of indra, went to the large starry way named suravithi, where he met with the saadhyas, vishvas, maruts, ashvins, aadityas, vasus, rudras, brahmarshis, raajarshis with dilipa at their head, tumburu, naarada, haahaa, and huhu. then he beheld indra, eulogized by gandharvas headed by vishvaavasu, etc and was seated on indras own seat and gandharvas, headed by tumburu, sang to them, and thousands of apsarases danced there . the gods and gandharvas offered him arghya, etc and caused him to enter the palace of indra. there he received indras weapons, the thunder bolt and lightning . at the request of indra he dwelt there for five years, and learned the dance and music of the gandharvas from citrasena, whom indra gave him as a friend, but he was longing for his brothers and kunti and thirsting for revenge . in the beginning, seeing that the eyes of arjuna were fixed upon urvashi, indra despatched citrasena to urvashi, who gladly consented to choose arjuna for her lover . urvashi related to arjuna that as he had looked on her only in a solemn assembly of celestials held on account of his coming, where the rudras, aadityas, ashvins, vasus, maharshis, raajarshis, siddhas, caaranas, yakshas, and mahoragas were present, and the gandharvas played the vinaas, and the apsarases danced, indra had caused citrasena to send her to him, and that she was herself in love with him. arjuna declared that he regarded her as the wife of his guru, and that he had been gazing at her because she was the mother of the paurava race. she replied that the sons and grandsons of purus race, that had come thither in consequence of ascetic merit, did all sport with the apsarases without incurring any sin. but arjuna swore that he regarded her as his mother. she then cursed him, saying that he should have to pass his time among females as a dancer and destitute of manhood, and then went away. indra told him that this would come to pass in the thirteenth year of their exile, when they would live unknown to all, but having passed one year thus he would regain his manhood. the desire of the man that listens to this history of arjuna never runs after lustful ends, etc. . one day the brahmarshi lomasha in the course of his wanderings went to the abode of indra. as lomasha within himself wondered how arjuna, being a kshatriya, had attained the seat of shakra, who was worshipped by the gods themselves, shakra, knowing his thoughts, explained to him who arjuna really was that moreover the asuras, the sons of danu, named the nivaatakavacas, who dwell in paataala, proud of a boon they had acquired, were planning the destruction of the gods, and could not be slain by others than either krishna or arjuna but madhusudana should not be urged when the task was insignificant, lest his energy should consume the whole universe therefore arjuna should slay them. at the request of indra, seconded by arjuna, lomasha went to the kaamyaka wood to yudhishthira in order to bring him news about arjuna and recommend him to visit the tirthas, and follow him and protect him from the raakshasas . as dhritaraashtra learnt from dvaipaa yana of arjunas arrival and stay at indras abode, he expressed his anxiety to sanjaya . conversation of sanjaya and dhritaraashtra about arjunas encounter with shiva in the guise of a kiraata, etc. . during the five years of arjunas absence the paandavas fed themselves and, snaataka brahmans, some with and some without fire, by killing deer, yudhishthira going towards the east, bhima towards the south, and the twins towards the west and north . having heard of the way of life of the paandavas, dhritaraashtra expressed his anxiety before sanjaya, fearing bhima with his iron mace, etc. sanjaya commemorated how krishna, dhrishtadyumna, viraata, dhrishta ketu, and the kaikeyas had visited the paandavas in the kaamyaka wood, whose conversations sanjaya had learnt through spies and formerly told dhritaraashtra, sanjaya further related that krishna had consented to become the charioteer of arjuna and to assist the paandavas in the battle, together with raama, akrura, gada, shaamba, pradyumna, aahuka, dhrishtadyumna, and the son of shishupaala, and yuyu dhaana, and the kaikeya and paancaala princes and the matsya king, and krishna had declared that yudhishthira should, along with his brothers living at haastinapura, rule the earth .

. b bhishma said once a brahman obtained a son named matanga, who, though procreated by a person of a different order, had, however, the rites of infancy and youth performed according to the ordinances laid n for brahmans. his father, desiring to perform a sacrifice, ordered him to collect the articles, and he set out riding in a car drawn by a young ass, that bore away the car to its mother matanga repeatedly struck the animal with his goad on its nose but the old she ass consoled it, saying, a caandaala it is that is driving thee there is no severity in a brahman. asked by matanga, the she ass revealed to him that his father was a shudra following the profession of a barber, who begat him upon a brahman woman excited with desire thou art, therefore, a caandaala by birth. matanga returned home, told his father what he had heard, retired to the forest, and began to undergo the austerest penances in order to acquire the status of a brahman, so that he scorched the very deities. indra came and offered him boons, but the status of a brahman, he said, could not be won by penances . matanga then stood for years on one foot. indra came once more and said from the order of brute life one attains to the state of humanity if born as a human being, one is sure to take birth as a pukkasha or a caandaala after, years one attains to the status of a shudra then after, years that of a vaishya after a period that is sixty times longer, that of a kshatriya after a period that is sixty times longer than this, to that of a fallen brahman after a period times as long, to that of a brahman living by the profession of arms after a period times as long, to that of a brahman reciting the gaayatri and sacred mantras after a period times as long, to that of a brahman conversant with the entire vedas and the scriptures . matanga then practised austerer penances, standing on one foot for, years in yoga meditation. indra once more came and said the same. matanga then repaired to gayaa, and there passed years on one foot in yoga, and was reduced to only skin and bones, and dropped n on the ground from sheer exhaustion. indra came quickly now matanga accepted the boons that he should be celebrated as chaneva, and obtain the worship of all women, and his fame should become unrivalled in the three worlds .

. questioned by yudhishthira about the misery endured by indra and shaci, shalya related once the prajaapati tvashtri, from antipathy to indra, created a son who had three heads, called vishvarupa. beholding his austerities, indra became alarmed, and in vain caused apsarases to tempt him then he slew him with his thunderbolt, but was yet afraid of his appearance, and prevailed upon a carpenter to cut off the heads out flew birds partridges, sparrows and hawks, quails. then tvashtri created vritra, who swallowed up indra. the gods created jrimbhikaa vritra yawned, and indra emerged. tvashtri strengthened vritra indra returned the gods consulted with the munis, and sitting on mount mandara, they thought of vishnu . indra, with . and ri repaired to vishnu, who taught them, with ri. and g to make eternal friendship between indra and vritra . indra then slew him in the evening with froth blended with the thunderbolt, in which vishnu had entered. g y raa m. u and ri. glorified indra. but indra was overpowered by falsehood and brahmanicide, and became bereft of his consciousness, and lay concealed in water the earth became treeless, the rivers were interrupted, the rains ceased . then ri. and . crowned nahusha as king of giving him their tapas whatever being may stand within thy sight daa y raa p g bh. thou shalt absorb his power. nahusha then assumed a sensual turn of mind, amusing himself with aps. and devakanyaa and vishvaavasu, naarada, g and the six seasons, in nandana, and on kailaasa, himavat, mandara, shveta, sahya, mahendra, malaya, etc. he ordained that shaci should wait upon him. shaci repaired to brihaspati, who promised soon to unite her with indra . nahusha became enraged the earth, with as g k m. u trembled nahusha reminded of indras behaviour towards ahalyaa, etc. at last the gods promised to bring him shaci but brihaspati, as a brahman, would not aban her, quoting a saying of brahmaan he told her to ask for time from nahusha, and so did the gods, led by agni . shaci obtained the boon from nahusha, and returned to brihaspati. with agni, repaired to vishnu, who said let indra offer sacrifice to me having performed the horse sacrifice, he will regain his dignity. . and ri. and brihaspati proceeded to the spot where indra was, performed a horse sacrifice, and divided the brahmahatyaa among trees and rivers and mountains and earth and women and indra was free from fever, but vanished again from fear of nahusha. shaci worshipped nishaa, who caused upashruti to appear, and shaci prayed to upashruti . upashruti, followed by shaci, crossed the heavenly groves and many mountains and came to the northern side of himavat, and thence to the sea in an island there was a large lake with an assemblage of lotuses there they found indra in the fibres of a lotus stalk, and, praising him, shaci implored his help against nahusha . indra said that nahusha had been strengthened by the ri. with the merits of offerings to . and p. shaci should tell nahusha to visit her on a vehicle borne by ri. nahusha consented. shaci prevailed upon brihaspati to find out indra, which he did by means of a sacrifice, prevailing upon agni to search for him. agni came back within the twinkling of an eye, having searched everywhere except in the waters, which he dared not enter . brihaspati praised agni and strengthened him with hymns of the veda agni then found out indra, and soon returned and informed brihaspati. this came with . ri. and g and praised indra by referring to his former deeds . indra increased little by little, and having assumed his original form he grew strong, and asked what business yet remained, as he had killed vishvarupa and vritra. brihaspati told him of nahusha, who had been strengthened by the power of the . ri etc and how nahusha, carried by m. ri journeyed from world to world. lp. kubera and yama vaivasvata and soma and varuna came and rejoiced that vishvarupa and vritra had been killed, and they and agni promised him their assistance against nahusha on the condition that they and agni should have their shares in sacrifices, and that kubera, yama, and varuna should this day be crowned along with indra . while

. b a brahman, who was a reciter, conversant with the six angas, of the kushika race and son of pippalaada, acquired spiritual insight into the angas at the foot of himavat he was devoted to the vedas silently reciting gaayatri, he practised austerities for, years in order to attain to braahman. then gaayatri appeared and granted him the boon that his wish for recitation should go on increasing, and his absorption into meditation be more complete. she added that he should not have to go to hell, thither where great brahmans go, but to the region of brahmaan, and that dharma, etc would come to him in person. he continued engaged in recitation for, celestial years. then dharma came to him and told him to cast off his body in order to win regions of bliss but he did not wish to reside in heaven except with his body, but only took pleasure in recitation. time, mrityu, and yama came and told him the same. the brahman gave them arghya and paadya. ikshvaaku, who had set out on a tirtha yaatraa, came and was given arghya and paadya. the brahman wished to give him something ikshvaaku, as a kshatriya, would not take anything except battle, but only himself give at last, however, he asked to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the brahmans recitations, but when the brahman consented he would not take them, and asked the brahman what those fruits were. the brahman did not know, as his recitations had never been connected with any special purpose he told the king that truth required that he should take them as he had asked for them . dharma and heaven seconded the brahman. ikshvaaku wished to give his own merits instead, but in vain then ikshvaaku agreed to accept half the brahmans merit on the condition that the brahman should take half of his own, but he was refused. at this time two ungainly individuals came there, virupa and vikrita virupa said that he owed vikrita the merits of the gift of a cow, but that vikrita refused to take repayment vikrita declared that virupa owed him nothing they asked ikshvaaku to decide the question. ikshvaaku hesitated the brahman threatened to curse him. ikshvaaku would give him some drops of water that had fallen upon his hand. virupa approved of this arrangement, and said that vikrita really did not owe him anything we appealed to thee for thy own sake. bhishma said that a reciter goes to brahmaan, or agni, or surya. whose attributes he catches stupefied by attachment and so also if he goes to soma, etc. if, however, he goes to, those regions after having freed himself from attachment, he enters the supreme and imperishable, and becomes braahman . the brahman accepted, worshipped dharma, etc and set himself to his recitations again. asked by ikshvaaku, he agreed that he should go half and half with the king. indra came there with lp saa vi etc and said to the brahman and the king that they had attained to success . those two withdrew their senses from the objects of the world fixing prana, etc in the heart, they concentrated the mind in praana and apaana united together, etc. . brahmaan welcomed the fiery flame that had issued from the head of the brahman, saying reciters attain to the same end as the yogins but as regards reciters, the honour is ordained for them that brahmaan himself shall advance to receive them then he once more imparted consciousness into that splenr the brahman then entered the mouth of brahmaan, and so did the king. the deities rejoiced. brahmaan said that so also would he that reads the great smriti and the anusmriti in this way attain to the same region with brahmaan and so also he who is devoted to yoga. then brahmaan disappeared, and the deities, having honoured dharma, returned to their respective abodes .

. as krishna thought that jaraasandha was incapable of being vanquished in battle even by all the gods and asuras, but might be vanquished in a personal struggle with bare arms, and as there was in himself policy, in bhima strength, and in arjuna ability to protect them, he thought that jaraasandha should be made to challenge bhima, and krishna therefore obtained the permission of yudhishthira that bhima and arjuna followed him. they set out in the garb of snaatakas, with bhima in the van, from the land of the kurus to the padmasaras, over kaalakuta, gandaki, mahaashona, sadaaniraa, the rivers on the ekaparvataka and purvaa koshalaa, mithilaa, maalaa, carmanvati, gangaa, shona, towards the east, dressed in garments of kusha grass, to the maagadha land. when they came to the mountain of goratha, they beheld the maagadha town . girivraja is surrounded by the five large hills of vaihaara, varaaha, vrishabha, rishigiri, and caityaka. it was there that gautama begat kaakshivat, etc upon the shudra woman aushinari, and was visited by the kings of anga, vanga, etc. there dwell the naagas arbuda, shakravaapin, svastika, and maninaaga. manu had ordered the maagadhas never to be afflicted with drought kaushika and manimat had favoured the country. the paandavas and krishna entered the city by breaking n the peak of caityaka, worshipped by the baarhadrathas and the citizens with perfumes and flower garlands, where brihadratha had slain the cannibal rishabha, and made of his hide three drums . as evil omens had been seen, the purohitas made jaraasandha mount an elephant and carried fire about him, and he entered upon a sacrifice with vows and fasts . krishna, bhima, and dhananjaya entered the city without weapons in the guise of snaatakas, snatched from the flower vens the garlands they had exposed for sale, and attired in robes of various colours and decked with garlands and ear rings they entered the abode of jaraasandha, who welcomed them, and hearing from krishna that bhima and arjuna in consequence of a vow would not speak before night, quartered them in the sacrificial apartments and retired to the palace . at midnight he came to them, as he always observed the vow, that as soon as he should hear of the arrival of snaatakas, even at midnight, he would immediately come out and grant them an audience. as he questioned them about their strange attire, which was unsuitable for snaatakas, and their breaking n the caityaka peak, and why they would not accept the worship he offered, krishna gave him some explanations, and declared that they had come as his foes . as jaraasandha said that he did not remember to have injured them, krishna told him that they were sent by yudhishthira to set at liberty the princes whom jaraasandha intended to slaughter as a sacrifice to shiva, because sacrificing human beings to the gods was never used he reminded him of the destruction of dambhodbhava, kaarta virya, uttara, and brihadratha, and challenged him to set free the monarchs or to fight. jaraasandha chose to fight, and ordered sahadeva, to be installed on the throne. then he thought of his generals kaushika and citrasena, who had formerly been hamsa and dimbhaka. krishna, remembering that, according to the command of brahmaan, jaraasandha was not to be slain by him or by the madhus, did not himself desire to slay him . jaraasandha having chosen to fight with bhima, the purohita brought pigment, garlands, etc and propitiatory ceremonies were performed by a brahman and likewise bhima, having consulted with krishna, had propitiatory ceremonies pronounced . when jaraasandha had taken off his crown and arranged his hair, they fought with their clenched fists as their only weapons. the combat began at the first day of the month kaarttika, and lasted, without intermission or food, till the thirteenth on the fourteenth night jaraasandha desisted from fatigue, and krishna obscurely intimated that he should now be killed . at the instigation of krishna, bhima threw jaraasandha into the air a hundred times, pressed his knee against his backbone and broke his body in two with a terrible roar, so that the citizens became dumb with terror and many women were prematurely delivered. leaving the lifeless body at the palace gate, they went out of the town riding on jaraasandhas celestial chariot, which krishna caused to be made ready, it being aned with a celestial flagstaff and incapable of being vanquished by any king, upon which indra and vishnu had fought in the battle about taarakaa, riding upon which indra had slain ninety nine daanavas, which had been obtained by king vasu from vaasava, from vasu by brihadratha, and from him by jaraasandha. and krishna thought of garuda, who sat upon the chariot along with the frightfully roaring creatures on its flagstaff. krishna then released his relatives and ordered them to assist yudhishthira at his raajasuya. stopping on a level plain outside the town, he was aed by the citizens, and he installed sahadeva, the son of jaraasandha, in the sovereignty of the magadhas. then they arrived at indra prastha. thereupon krishna, having taken leave of yudhi shthira, etc set out for his own city, riding upon that same celestial chariot that had been given to him by yudhishthira, the paandavas having circumambulated him

weapon, etc. . arjuna jayadratha arjuna cut off jayadrathas standard and slew his driver jayadratha was placed by six chariot warriors in their midst. krishna covered the sun by means of his yoga power, so that all, except arjuna, thought the sun to have set, and he urged arjuna to cut off jayadrathas head without delay arjuna caused such a carnage that the warriors abaned jayadratha in fear and fled away krishna again urged arjuna to cut off jayadrathas head without delay, telling him of jayadrathas father vriddha kshatra, who was still engaged in penances outside samantapancaka arjuna should make the head fall upon the lap of vriddhakshatra himself, lest his own head should crack in pieces this arjuna did, and as the head fell n from vriddhakshatras lap the latters head split into pieces. krishna then withdrew the darkness created by him krishna and arjuna blew their conches, and bhima, by a tremens shout, communicated to yudhishthira the message of victory. yudhishthira drona, after the sun had set and arjuna fought with many mighty chariot warriors . kripa ashvatthaaman arjuna kripa was carried away by his driver, and ashvatthaaman fled. arjuna, grieved at kripas death like swoon, karna arjuna saatyaki the two paancaala princes . krishna told arjuna to avoid karna because the latter had yet the lance that indra had given him. karna saatyaki yudhaamanyu and

of duryodhana. saatyaki did not slay the dhaarta raashtras on account of the vow of bhimasena. ashvatthaaman, kritavarman, etc were all vanquished by saatyaki with only one bow in this world there are only three mighty bowmen krishna, arjuna, and saatyaki, said sanjaya. the younger brother of daaruka soon brought another chariot to saatyaki saatyaki ascended it, and daaruka went to krishna. a new chariot was brought for karna also. sanjaya told dhritaraashtra that thirty one of his sons had been slain by bhimasena, etc. . insulted by karna, bhima addressed arjuna in order to induce the latter to permit him to slay karna arjuna rebuked karna, and vowed to slay his son vrishasena in his presence. krishna congratulated arjuna, who attributed the victory to krishna krishna pointed out to arjuna the results of that days battle then he blew paancajanya and went and informed yudhishthira . krishna congratulated yudhishthira, who attributed the success to krishnas grace krishna and arjuna once more congratulated him then bhima and saatyaki, whom yudhishthira congratulated and embraced . duryodhanas despondency and cheerless address to drona, whom he censured for treating arjuna leniently it seems that karna only now wishes us victory . dronas reply to duryodhana he vowed to slay all the paancaalas before fing his armour he asked duryodhana to tell ashvatthaaman to avenge himself on the somakas, etc even at the risk of his life. then he proceeded against the paandavas . duryodhana communicated to karna his suspicions about dronas sincerity karna removed duryodhanas suspicions of drona, and attributed the ill success of the kurus to destiny. meanwhile the paandava divisions appeared for battle, and a fierce battle ensued .
. bhima seized jayadratha by the hair, and holding him high up in the air thrust him on the ground, etc and regretted that yudhishthira had forbidden to kill him. he then with his arrow shaved jayadrathas head, leaving only five tufts of hair, and made him promise to say in public assemblies, am the slave of the paandavas. they then bound him and thrust him into the chariot then they drove towards the hermitage and presented him to yudhishthira. yudhishthira and draupadi set him free with his army. jayadratha went to gangaadvaara, and pleased shiva so that he deigned to accept his offerings in person and granted him a boon. jayadratha asked that he might be able to defeat in battle all the five paandavas on their chariots. this shiva declared to be impossible, as arjuna was invincible, and was protected by krishna, who was vishnu . shiva then briefly reminded jayadratha of four incarnations of vishnu . thou shalt, however, be able to vanquish for a single day only the rest of yudhishthiras forces and the four paandavas, but not arjuna. then shiva vanished with umaa, jayadratha returned home, and the paandavas continued to dwell in kaamyaka .

for his charioteer, the chariot given him by agni, his steed, and his standard with the ape. he desired to have shalya to drive his chariot duryodhana solicited shalya to comply with karnas wishes shalya took offence at the proposal duryodhana repeated his request in honorific words, and shalya accepted on the condition that he might in karnas presence, utter whatever he desired . duryodhana related to shalya tripuraakhyaana, which the great ri. maarkandeya had narrated to his father. as brahmaan, ...the supreme deity acted as the driver of rudra, so thou restrain the steeds of karna . he then related a story of parashu raama, which a virtuous brahman had recited in the presence of his father. raama gave the dhanurveda to karna, whom not think to have been born in the suta order, but to be the son of a god, born in the kshatriya order and abaned in infancy . duryodhana said so did brahman act as rudras driver the driver should be superior to the warrior thou art selected by us as superior to karna. shalya said that many a time he had heard this history recited to him, and krishna, knowing the same, had become the charioteer of arjuna, and would fight if arjuna were slain.

shalya, who embraced duryodhana and asked their forgiveness for the words he might speak to karna for his good what shall say, in order to inspire thee confidence, is fraught with self adulation am a driver like maatali himself . duryodhana said to karna shalya, who is superior to krishna, will act as a driver, like maatali to indra. when the morning came, duryodhana again successfully asked shalya to become karnas charioteer. karna having worshipped the chariot, they both ascended it. duryodhana once more addressed karna . karna told shalya to urge the steeds that he might slay arjuna, etc. shalya endeavoured to inspire karna with fear by eulogizing the paandavas . when karna set out there appeared ill omens. the kuru army, however, was filled with joy. karna reflected and boasted . shalya ridiculed him and praised arjuna . karna proceeded on his chariot with white steeds and tiger skins, slaying large numbers in battle along his way, and inquired after arjuna, promising every paandava soldier that he met that unto him who pointed out arjuna to him he would give whatever wealth he desired. duryodhana and the troops rejoiced shalya scornfully laughed, and said that karna would get to see arjuna without the trouble of seeking him, and asked him to aban his desire for a single combat with arjuna. karna repeated his resolution, and shalya insulted him in a long speech . karna replied angrily, describing the dis reputable practices of the madrakas . shalya answered by praising himself and his accomplishments as a charioteer, and by reciting the story of the crow and the swan even as that crow, fed upon the remains of the dinners of the vaishya children, disregarded his equals and superiors, so t thou, that art fed by the sons of dhritaraashtra upon the remains of their dishes, disregard all, etc. . karna said that krishna and arjuna were well known to him, but did not make him afraid. the curse, however, of raama pained him greatly. he dwelt, disguised as a brahman, with raama in former days, desirous of obtaining celestial weapons from him. indra, as a worm, began to pierce his thigh, on which was lying the head of the sleeping raama therefore he did not move. but raama, witnessing his patience, discovered that he was not a brahman, and cursed him, saying that this weapon would never, in the time of need, when the hour of his death came, occur to his memory. he had forgotten the weapon, but would, notwithstanding, slay arjuna he suspected shalya of secret friendship with the paandavas he would employ the braahma weapon, which arjuna would never be able to escape, if only the wheels of karnas chariot did not sink into the earth that day he would not take fright at yama himself with his rod, or varuna with his noose, or kubera with his mace, or indra with the thunderbolt. once upon a time, while wandering for the sake of practising with my bow vijaya, had heedlessly struck the calf of a brahmans homa cow the brahman cursed me, saying that my wheel would sink into the earth in a battle when was in great danger. the kings of the lunar race offered to give that brahman, kine and bulls, but in vain, etc. . karna said that it was in vain that shalya tried to frighten him . karna said that in dhritaraashtras abode the brahmans used to give accounts of various delightful regions and many kings of ancient times an old brahman had said, blaming the madrakas and the baahikas, that they should be avoided as being out of the pale of virtue and living away from himavat, etc but between sindhu and its tributary rivers. on some very secret mission karna had to live among the baahikas, and therefore their conduct was well known to him there is a town shaakala, a river aapagaa, and a baahika clan jarttikas the practices of these people are very censurable . p and brahmans never accept gifts from those that are fallen, or those that are begotten by shudras on the girls of other castes, or the baahikas, who never perform sacrifices and are exceedingly irreligious. he mentioned three impure places . there were two pishaacas in the river vipaashaa, named bahi and hika the baahikas are the offspring of those two psh. they are not creatures created by the creator. the kaarashkaras, etc and other peoples of no religion one should always avoid even thus did a riaa. woman speak to a brahman who went to that country for bathing in sacred water and passed a single night there. the regions are called aarattaa, the water baahika the lowest brahmans have resided there from very remote times, without the vedas, etc. the prasthalas, etc are almost as blameable in their practices . karna continued his description of the baahikas . the aarattas had been cursed by a chaste woman. the kauravas, etc know what the eternal religion is. brahmaan, even in the krita age, had censured the practices of the country of the five rivers. k. quoted a saying of the raa. kalmaashapaada, declared by the raakshasa to be the formula for curing a person possessed by a raa. or killed by poison. remarks on the paancaalas, etc on agni, etc. . shalya spoke in dis paragement of the angas . duryodhana restored peace between karna and shalya . the seven teenth days battle. beholding the array of the paarthas made by dhrishtadyumna, karna proceeded to battle and assailed yudhishthira. dhritaraashtra inquired about the disposition of the kuru forces . sanjaya described the kaurava array right wing on the right of these the left side on their left in the centre at the head karna with his sons in the rear dushaasana and behind him duryodhana and his brothers, protected by the united madrakas and kekayas ashvatthaaman, etc with mlecchas on elephants followed behind. the array was formed according to the plan of brihaspati. yudhishthira, beholding karna, spoke to arjuna of the hostile array arjuna should proceed against karna bhimasena against duryodhana nakula against vrishasena sahadeva against shakuni shataanika against dushaasana saatyaki against kritavarman paandya against ashvatthaaman yudhishthira against kripa the draupadeyas with shikhandin against the rest of the dhaartaraashtras, etc. shalya pointed out to karna the chariot of arjuna and various omens, etc. how the samshaptakas threatened to slay arjuna and the other heroes of the paandava army, and he dissuaded him from trying to slay arjuna. meanwhile the two armies mingled fiercely in battle . dhritaraashtra asked sanjaya about arjuna, the sam shaptakas, and karna. sanjaya related arjuna arrayed his troops, headed by dhrishtadyumna by the side of dhrishtadyumna the draupadeyas. arjuna the samshaptakas. the paancaalas, etc the kurus kripa, etc the koshalas, etc. the battle became conducive to fame, heaven, and virtue for the kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra heroes that engaged in it. duryodhana, etc. karna the paandavas, etc. karna harassed yudhishthira fierce battle between the kurus and the srinjayas . dhritaraashtra inquired about the particulars of karnas encounter with yudhishthira. sanjaya related karna attacked the paancaalas and made a great slaughter among others he slew the five paancaalas bhaanudeva, etc. . the protectors of karnas chariot wheels were his sons sushena and satyasena, and his eldest son vrishasena protected his rear. dhrishtadyumna, etc karna karnas sons sushena

snakes that had sided with takshakas son they penetrated krishnas body, entered the earth, and, having bathed, returned to karna, but were cut off by arjuna, who then covered karnas chariot with showers of arrows and slew, kurus, who had been urged by duryodhana to fight. the kurus fled, leaving karna to fight singly with arjuna . karna baffled arjunas weapon karna and arjuna shot at each other dense showers of arrows. the snake ashvasena, who was hostile to arjuna, was passing his time in the nether region, having escaped from the conflagration at khaandava recollecting the death of his mother he now soared up and entered into karnas quiver in the shape of an arrow. karna and arjuna were fanned and sprinkled with fragrant sandal water by many aps. staying in the welkin, and shakra and surya with their hands gently brushed their faces. karna aimed that arrow, born in airaavatas race, which he had long kept for arjunas destruction, and which lay singly in a golden quiver amid sandal dust omens appeared, and the lokapaalas with shakra raised loud wails. karna did not know that the snake ashvasena had entered his arrow by the aid of his yoga powers. shalya in vain exhorted karna to take another arrow karna said karna never aims an arrow twice persons like us never become crooked warriors. krishna with his feet pressed arjunas chariot about a cubit into the earth, and the snake arrow, failing to strike off arjunas head, broke his diadem, incapable of being crushed by rudra, etc. . celestial flowers were showered upon krishna, etc. ashvasena appeared to karna and asked him to shoot the same weapon again karna refused to avail himself of anothers help or shoot the same shaft twice. ashvasena then, of his own accord, rushed on arjuna in the shape of an arrow krishna informed arjuna that it was ashvasena, who, as an unborn child, was saved with his mother at khaandava. arjuna cut the snake into pieces, and krshna with his arms raised the chariot from the earth. once, when karna was stupefied and stood inactive, arjuna was disinclined to slay him in such distress, but he was taught by krishna never to spare an enemy, however weak. at that time, when the hour of karnas death had come, kaala, approaching invisibly, in consequence of the brahmans wrath, said the earth is swallowing up thy wheel, and the weapon that raama had given him escaped from his memory, and the earth engulfed his left wheel. karna began to rail at righteousness as not always protecting its worshippers. karna invoked the braahma weapon, and arjuna the aindra weapon, which was baffled by karna urged by krishna to shoot high weapons, arjuna shot the braahma weapon. karna cut off, one after another, eleven bowstrings of arjunas, not knowing that arjuna had one hundred strings to his bow urged by krishna to strike karna with superior weapons, arjuna then consecrated another celestial weapon with mantras, uniting the raudra weapon with it. at that time the earth swallowed up one of karnas wheels. quickly alighting, karna seized his sunken wheel with his two arms and endeavoured to lift it up the earth rose up to the height of four fingers breadth, with her seven islands, etc. karna shed tears from wrath and asked arjuna to wait for a moment till he had lifted his sunken wheel . krishna taunted karna for appealing to virtue and the rules of fair fight by reminding him of all the wrongs e to the paandavas by himself. and duryodhana acting according to his counsels . karna dropped his head in shame and gave no answer, and continued to fight. krishna urged arjuna to pierce karna with a celestial weapon arjuna, remembering the incidents alluded to by krishna, blazed up with fury blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate from all the pores of his body, a sight that appeared exceedingly wonderful. both karna and arjuna invoked the braahma weapon, and karna once more made an effort to extricate his chariot. arjuna shot an agni weapon, quenched by karna with a vaaruna weapon, covering all the points of the compass with darkness, which arjuna dispelled with the vaayavya weapon. pierced by a shaft of karnas, while the earth trembled, etc arjuna began to reel, the gaandiva dropped from his hand, etc. at the interval karna fruitlessly endeavoured to extricate his chariot. recovering his senses, arjuna took up an anjalika weapon. urged by krishna to cut off the head of karna, arjuna cut off his standard, and then, with an anjalika weapon, struck off karnas head before karna could mount his chariot. a light issued from karnas body and entered the sun. the paandavas rejoiced . duryodhana, etc grieved bhima, uttering loud roars, frightened the kauravas, etc. . shalya informed duryodhana of karnas death . duryodhana became almost deprived of his senses . requested by dhritaraashtra, sanjaya related the state of the kaurava army after karnas fall . duryodhana resolved to make a final stand . bhimasena and dhrishtadyumna

valour he rallied the remnants of his troops and exhorted them to fight they fled away heedless of his words . shalya described to duryodhana the carnage on the field, and urged the withdrawal of the troops to their nightly quarters. having repeatedly comforted duryodhana, they retired headed by ashvatthaaman. karna did not lose his splenr. ri etc retired. the portents that were seen at karnas fall. arjuna and krishna blew their conches, at which the kauravas left the field, deserting shalya and duryodhana. g men, caa m. ri y and m. u. congratulated krishna and arjuna . enumeration of the kauravas retiring from the field . urged by krishna, who told dhrishtadyumna, etc to stand there with care, arjuna presented himself to yudhishthira, who, rising from his bed, greeted arjuna and krishna krishna congratulated yudhishthira, who ascribed his success to krishnas influence . yudhishthira, with krishna and arjuna, came back to the field to have a look at karnas body. the kings, filled with joy, approached yudhishthira and gladdened him greatly so nakula, etc. . dhritaraashtra and gaandhaari swooned away and were comforted by vidura, sanjaya, and the kuru ladies. the fruits

. nakula questioned bhishma as to which is really the foremost of weapons, and how the sword was first created and for what purpose, and who was the first instructor in the use of that weapon. bhishma related that in ancient times the universe was one vast expanse of water, enveloped in darkness, etc. there pitaamaha took his birth, he then created wind, fire, etc and then assuming a visible form he begot marici, etc. daksha . when sarvaloka pitaamaha had called into existence all creatures he promulgated the eternal religion laid n in the vedas. that religion was accepted by the gods with their preceptors and priests, and by aa r s m a bhrigu, atri, angiras, si the kaashyapas, vasishtha, etc. all of them lived in obedience to brahmaan. but the foremost of the daanavas, hiranyakashipu, etc and many other daityas and daanavas, filled with wrath and covetousness, took delight in all kinds of wicked acts, etc wielding only the rod of chastisement those foremost of asuras forsook every kindly intercourse with other creatures. then brahmaan with the brahmarshis proceeded to a delightful summit of himavat, and after, years he arranged a sacrifice. from the sacrificial fire arose asi, which brahmaan gave to rudra in order to enable him to put n irreligion. rudra with the sword destroyed and dispersed the asuras some of them penetrated into the bowels of the earth, others got under the cover of the mountains, some went upwards, others entered the depths of the sea. rudra then gave the sword to vishnu, vishnu to marici, marici to the maharshis, the maharshis to vaasava, mahendra to the lokapaalas, the lokapaalas to manu the son of surya. he gave it to his son kshupa. thence it passed successively to ikshvaaku, etc from drona to kripa, from kripa to thee and thy brothers. krittikaa is the nakshatra of the sword, agni its deity, rohini its gotra, rudra its high preceptor. its eight mysterious names are asi, etc. . of all weapons the sword is the foremost the puraanas truly declare that it was first wielded by maheshvara . prithu created the first bow. persons skilled in weapons should always worship the sword. blessing to the reader .

. b . bhishma said in days of old, when the emancipated brahman vyaasa roamed over the world, he saw a worm speedily moving on a chariot road. asked by vyaasa, who was omniscient and knew the language of every animal, the worm said that it was running away from a large cart, lest it should be killed every creature, in whatever situation it may be placed, becomes attached to it in even this order of being am happy, think, and wish to live in his former life he was a cruel shudra, a usurer, etc never dedicating food to . and p etc. he now was filled with repentance and grief he had, however, worshipped his old mother, and once showed hospitality to a brahman in consequence thereof the memory had not forsaken him, and he thought he should once more regain happiness . vyaasa said it is the consequence of a meritorious act of mine that thou art not stupefied in consequence of my penances am able to rescue a being of demerit by the simply granting him sight of my person there is no stronger power than that of penances. thou mayst again attain to righteousness and merit the state of a worm is really fraught with great misery. the superior brahman worships the sun and the moon uttering mantras when thou hast attained to that state, shall impart to thee braahman. the worm remained and was killed by the cart. he was reborn in diverse orders of being, such as a porcupine, iguana, boar, deer, bird, caandaala, shudra, and vaishya. born at last as a kshatriya through the grace of vyaasa, he came and worshipped him. vyaasa said that the sin of his former life had yet not been destroyed he should become a brahman by giving up his life on the field of battle for the sake of cows or brahmans performing many sacrifices he should attain to heaven, and after emancipation he should enjoy eternal happiness. the ascending order of transmigration is animal shudra vaishya kshatriya brahman svarga . he betook himself to severe austerities vyaasa went to him and said that the penances of the kshatriyas consist in the protection of all creatures thereby he should attain to the state of a brahman. then he protected his subjects righteously, and after death became a brahman. vyaasa came and told him not to fear death, but only the loss of righteousness. he caused the earth to be marked with sacrificial stakes, and then obtained a residence in the region of brahmaan himself, and obtained the eternal braahman by his own acts, according to the words of vyaasa. also the kshatriyas, who have been slain, have attained to a meritorious end therefore, not mourn on their account .

. b bhishma related gautama, a brahman, belonging to the middle country, devoid of vedic learning, entered a village desirous of obtaining charity. in that village lived a robber, possessed of great wealth, devoted to the brahmans, etc. he gave to gautama a piece of new cloth, a wied young woman, and a house. gautama lived happily in that village of aborigines for many years, helping the relatives of his wife, the female slave . he began to practise archery, and went into the woods and killed wild cranes, etc in abundance, and became like one of the robbers. one day a brahman, devoted to the study of the vedas, etc and who did never accept any food if given by a shudra, came to the house of his ancient friend gautama. seeing gautama, who resembled a cannibal, he exhorted him to aban his sinful mode of life. gautama, repenting, agreed to leave this village next morning with his guest, who passed the night there, refraining touching anything . next morning, when the guest had left the house, gautama proceeded towards the sea, having met with a caravan of merchants. the caravan was assailed by an infuriated elephant, but gautama managed to escape, and fled towards the north, not knowing whither he proceeded, wandering alone in the forest like a kimpurusha. at last he reached a delightful forest, resembling the very woods of nandana, and inhabited by y. and k aned with shaalas, etc with bhaarundas, bhulingas, etc. under a delightful banyan tree he fell asleep when the sun had set, the king of cranes, naadijangha or raajadharman, kashyapas son, the child of a celestial maiden, one of the daughters of daksha, and possessed of great wis and a friend of brahmaan, came home from brahmaloka. exhausted with hunger and thirst, gautama thought of slaying him. naadijangha welcomed gautama, and asked him to stay with him till the next morning . he, who equalled yama himself in his knowledge of duties, made for him a bed of the shaala flowers, and offered him large fishes from the bhaagirathi, etc. learning that he was desirous of going to the sea in order to earn wealth, he, quoting brihaspati as to the fourfold means of earning wealth, directed him in the morning to his friend, the chief of the raakshasas, virupaaksha, about yojanas away. gautama reached the city of meruvraja, and was welcomed by virupaaksha . though not satisfied with gautamas antecedents, virupaaksha, because gautama was a brahman, and for the sake of raaja dharman, entertained him with the, brahmans that were to be entertained in his house on the day of full moon of the kaarttika month . some amongst them were selected to represent the . p and the deities of fire. this he did every year on the aashaadhi and maaghi, and especially on the kaarttiki, after the expiry of the autumn, giving away gold, jewels, etc. on this one day there was no fear of raa. gautama came away with much wealth, and returned to raajadharman, who welcomed him. having no food to live on by the way, he thought of slaying raajadharman . this he did having plucked off the feathers and the n, he roasted the flesh, and taking it up together with the gold he had brought, he quickly fled from the spot. the next day virupaaksha became anxious because he had not for two mornings and two nights seen raajadharman, who when returning from brahmaloka every morning never went home without paying him a visit he suspected that gautama had slain him, and sent his son with other raa. to inquire after him. gautama was caught and brought to meruvraja as the raa. refused to eat the flesh of that great sinner, he was hacked into pieces, which were given away to the robbers. but the very robbers, though cannibals, refused to eat the flesh of that vile man . virupaaksha caused a funeral pyre, etc to be made for raajadharman. at that time the goddess surabhi, the daughter of daksha, appeared in the sky above the pyre from her mouth froth mixed with milk fell upon the funeral pyre, and raajadharman became revived. indra came and related that once raajadharman had absented himself from brahmaloka and was cursed by brahmaan, who said that he should not die soon therefore he has come back to life. asked by raajadharman on behalf of his dear friend gautama, indra sprinkled amrita over gautama, and restored him to life. raajadharman embraced him with great joy, dismissed him with his wealth, and returned home. at the due hour he repaired to brahmaloka and was honoured by brahmaan. gautama begot many sinful children upon his shudraa wife. according to a heavy curse denounced upon him by the gods, he afterwards had to sink into a terrible hell for many years. all this was recited to me formerly by naarada.

said that krishna and maarkandeya would come to see them. immediately krishna arrived with satyabhaamaa on his chariot that was yoked with shaibya and sugriva. he told krishnaa that her sons, though her father and brothers proffered them a king and territories, found no joy in the house of drupada, but that in the town of the vrishnis they were directed by subhadraa and received instruction from raukmineya even as aniruddha, abhimanyu, sunitha, and bhaanu, and were instructed by the young abhimanyu in the use of arms. then he suggested to yudhishthira with the dashaarhas, kukuras, and

flooding the entire surface of the earth and showering incessantly for twelve years. then svayambhu, dwelling in the lotus, drinks this terrible wind and goes to sleep. when all has become water, alone wander in affliction and become fatigued, and find no resting place. then behold a vast banyan tree, and on a couch attached to a bough of that tree a fair boy with yellow robes, with the mark of shrivatsa. he caused me to enter his body through the mouth, and then beheld the whole earth with cities and kings, gangaa, shatadru, etc gods, saadhyas, rudras, aadityas, etc at last was suddenly projected through his open mouth by a gust of wind. within that very moment acquired a new sight and beheld myself emancipated . wished to know his self. then he spoke to me the gods even not know me truly. am naaraayana, the eternal and unchangeable source of all things, the creator and destroyer of all am vishnu, brahmaan, shakra, etc. in the form of shesha support this earth, in the form of a boar raised it when sunk in water am the vadavaavaktra fire from my mouth, arms, thighs, and feet sprang brahmans, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and shudras from me spring the rig saama, yajur, and atharva veda am the samvartaka fire, the samvartaka wind, the samvartaka sun, and the samvartaka fire the stars are the pores of my skin, etc. when virtue and morality decrease, create myself into new forms in the krita age become white, etc. . when the end comes, alone in the form of kaala destroy the three worlds, etc. the grandsire of all creatures is half of my body. am the bearer of the conch shell, the discus, and the mace. for a period of, cycles of yugas sleep, overwhelming all creatures in insensibility, and stay here, in the form of a boy though am old, until brahmaan wakes up under the form of brahmaan have repeatedly granted thee boons when brahmaan awakes, will then alone create all creatures. then he disappeared, and beheld this creation start into life. and that deity is krishna, thy relative. in consequence of the boon granted by him memory s not fail me, my life is long, and death is under my control . then all bowed n unto janaardana, who comforted them . yudhishthira asked him about the future cause of the government of the earth. maarkandeya, having given a short description of the other yugas, described in detail the kali yuga in the new krita yuga, kalkin will arise. then maarkandeya gave yudhishthira some moral precepts and exhortations . vaamadevacarita . baka shakra samvaada . shibi . naahusha carita on the same topic there were two learned and able kings, vrishadarbha and seduka. seduka knew that vrisha darbha had from his boyhood an unuttered vow, that he would give no other metal to brahmans than gold and silver. he once sent a brahman, who asked him for, horses for his preceptor, to vrishadarbha, who whipped him and then gave him a days tribute, because he had whipped him . shibi . raajanyamahaabhaagya . indradyumnopaakhyaana . asked by yudhishthira in what condition a man should practise charity, maarkandeya enumerated four kinds of futile life and sixteen kinds of futile charity. the brahmans save others and themselves by japa, mantra, and homa. he next enume rated the brahmans that should be excluded from shraaddhas, and gave other moral precepts then he enumerated the persons to whom one should make gifts the effects of various gifts to brahmans . yamaloka . precepts about gifts, washing the feet of brahmans, etc. blessing upon the reader. three kinds of purity by aing sandhyaa and reciting gaayatri one is protected against sin and evil results from gifts, against inauspicious stars, and against raakshasas. greatness of the brahmans. the carrying of three staves, etc are useless if the heart be not pure. they who not commit sin in manas, word, deed, and buddhi really practise austerities . on the effects of various gifts at various times . having heard the history of indradyumna, yudhishthira, saying that maarkandeya knew the gods, daanavas, raakshasas, the royal genealogies and the genealogies of the rishis, and gandharvas, yakshas, kinnaras, and apsarases, asked him about kuva laashva ikshvaaku. maarkandeya related dhundhumaaropaakhyaana . pativratopaakhyaana . angirasa . skanpatti . skanda shakra samaagama . skanaakhyaana . manushyagrahakathana . skandayuddha . kaarttikeyastava .

maatali, the charioteer of indra . the following synonyms shakrasaarathi, . devasaarathi, .
maataliya, adj. .
. . the holy rishi kanva said to duryodhana in the assembly of the kurus brahmaan, the grandsire of the universe, is indestructible and eternal. the holy rishis nara and naaraayana are of the same character. of all the sons of aditi, vishnu alone is eternal...in this connection is cited an old story maatali, the charioteer of indra, had, by his wife sudharmaa, one beautiful daughter, gunakeshi. as he found no suitable husband for her amongst dai g or men and ri maatali set out for the naagaloka . on the way naarada, proceeding to visit varuna, followed maatali, and first showed him the abode of varuna, surrounded by his sons and grandsons. varunas son pushkara had been chosen as husband by somas daughter jyotsnaakaali . he then showed him the abode, entirely made of gold, of the liquor to the possession of that liquor the gods owe their being suraa. he showed him also the weapons that had belonged to the daityas and had been obtained by the gods as a booty of war when hurled at the foe they always return into the hand that hurls them. here dwelt in days of yore many tribes of raa. and dai. here is that fire of blazing flames and the discus of vishnu and that knotty bow that was created for the destruction of the world it is always protected with great vigilance by the gods, and it is from this bow that the one wielded by arjuna has taken its name it is endued with the strength of, bows it punishes all wicked kings it was first created by brahmaan and praised by shukra it is held by the sons of the lord of waters. he showed him also varunas umbrella in the umbrella house, always dropping water that cannot be seen. innumerable are the wonders to be seen here . in the very centre of the naagaloka is the city paataala with daityas and daanavas, the asura fire, fed by water here the gods, having first vanquished their foes, quaffed the amrita and deposited the residue the aaditya hayashiras from here airaavata takes up water in order to impart it to the clouds, and it is that water which indra pours n as rain aquatic animals, the timi, etc which subsist on the rays of the moon here mahaadeva practised ascetic austerities for the benefit of all creatures maharshis addicted to the vow of go here in the race of the celebrated elephant supratika were born the elephants airaavana, vaamana, kumuda, and anjana an egg in the waters from the commencement of the creation, whence, when the end of the world comes, a fire bursts forth and consumes the three worlds, etc. maatali said no one here seems to be eligible . in paataala is hiranyapura, built by the daanava maya, belonging to the daityas and daanavas, who in days of yore lived here having obtained boons, exhibiting, different kinds of illusion, incapable of being vanquished by shakra, yama, varuna, or kubera, etc. the kaalakhanjas and the yaatudhaanas the nivaatakavacas many times, o maatali thou with thy son gomukha and indra hadst to retreat before them description of their abodes . maatali would not choose a son in law among the daanavas, the enemies of the gods as regards thyself, know that thy heart is ever set on fomenting quarrels . then the world of the suparnas, who subsist on snakes and have sprung from the six sons of garuda sumukha, etc of kashyapas and vinataas race, aned with the shrivatsa, belonging to the kshatriya order, for they never attain to brahmanhood in consequence of their preying upon their kinsmen they are shown favour by vishnu, and ae vishnu. the names of the principal are suvarnacuda, etc. . rasaatala is the seventh stratum below the earth here dwells surabhi, the mother of kine, born of the amrita her milk springs from the essence of the six different kinds of tastes she sprang of old from the mouth of brahmaan, who was gratified with drinking the amrita and vomited the best of things . a jet of her milk created the milky ocean, covered with white foam that is the food of the ascetics phenapaa the very gods fear them because of their austerities. from surabhi are born the four kine that support the quarters in the east surupaa, in the south hamsikaa, in the west subhadraa, in the north sarvakaamadughaa. the gods and the asuras, making mandara their pole, churned the ocean, and obtained vaaruni, lakshmi, amrita, uccaishravas, and kaustubha. surabhi milks sudhaa to those who live on sudhaa, svadhaa to those who live on svadhaa, and amrita to those who live on amrita . the gaathaa that was sung by the dwellers of rasaatala in days of old is still heard to be recited in the world by persons of learning neither in the naaga loka, nor in svarga, nor in a vimaana, nor in heaven is residence so happy as in rasaatala . the city of bhogavati resembles indras city amaraavati it is ruled over by vaasuki, the king of the naagas here dwells shesha here dwell the innumerable naagas, the sons of surasaa, wearing svastika, etc. the principal are vaasuki, etc. . maatali wished to get for his son in law the naaga sumukha of airaavatas race, the son of cikura, and the grandson of aaryaka kauravya and the daughters son of vaamana . naarada introduced maatali to aaryaka as the friend and charioteer of indra, who drives his chariot drawn by, steeds, and thereby has vanquished the enemies of the gods. aaryaka objected that garuda, who had slain cikura, when he left these regions had said that after a month he would devour sumukha also. according to a proposal of maatali, they all visited indra and vishnu vishnu proposed to give amrita to sumukha but indra disagreed on account of the prowess of garuda instead he gave him an excellent lease of life, and having married maatalis daughter he returned home . garuda made remonstrances to indra, saying that he, like him, can without any fatigue bear the weight of the three worlds that he had slain the daityas shrutashri, etc. that he not only perches on vishnus flagstaff, but sometimes carries him with all his friends on his back, and he can carry vishnu without fatigue on only one of his feathers. vishnu shows him that he cannot bear the weight of his one right arm then he threw sumukha with the toe of his foot upon garudas breast. and from that time garuda has ever lived with that snake. kanva continued in the same way, o duryodhana thou canst not encounter bhima, etc. . duryodhana, fixing his eyes on karna, burst into laughter, saying am precisely what the creator has made me .

. vaisham paayana said when the year was reached, yudhishthira beheld many unusual portents . a little while afterwards he heard of the wholesale carnage of the vrishnis in a battle with clubs, where only krishna and raama had escaped with life he summoned his brothers and took counsel with them they were filled with grief the death of krishna they could not believe. janamejaya inquired about the particulars of the destruction of the vrishnis and andhakas. vaishampaayana said when the year.... asked by janamejaya, cursed by whom the vrishnis, etc met with destruction, vaishampaayana said saarana, etc saw vishvaamitra, kanva, and naarada arrived at dvaarakaa they disguised shaamba as a woman, calling her the wife of babhru, and asked the ascetics what this one would bring forth. the ascetics answered this shaamba will bring forth a terrible iron club for the destruction of the vrishnis and andhakas, except raama and krishna . then they went to krishna. informed of what had taken place, krishna summoned all the vrishnis and told them of it, but did not try to annul the curse. the next day shaamba actually brought forth an iron club. the fact was reported to the king, who caused it to be reduced into powder and thrown into the sea. at the command of aahuka, etc the manufacture of spirits was forbidden among all the vrishnis and andhakas, under the penance of being impaled alive with all ones kinsmen. all the citizens bound themselves by the rule . time every day wandered about their houses, like a man of terrible and fierce aspect, bald head, black and tawny of complexion they shot innumerable arrows at him, without being able to pierce him. also other dreadful portents of calamity were daily seen by the vrishnis throughout the city . they showed disregard for brahmans, p and etc except raama and krishna, etc. when the paanca janya was blown in their houses, asses brayed aloud from every direction. krishna, seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the lunation, summoned the yaadavas and said the lunation has been made the by raahu once more, as at the time of the great battle of the bharatas . he understood that the year had come according to the curse of gaandhaari, and that the omens were similar to those which yudhishthira had noticed when the two armies were arrayed in order of battle. he endeavoured to bring about those occurrences which would make gaandhaaris words true. he commanded the vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water, and caused the messengers to proclaim a journey to the sea coast . at that time the vrishni ladies dreamt every night that a black woman with white teeth, entering their abodes, laughed aloud and ran through dvaarakaa stealing the men dreamt of vultures that devoured the vrishnis and andhakas in the houses and fire chambers their ornaments, etc were taken away by raa. the iron discus of krishna, given by agni, with a nave of adamant, ascended to heaven. krishnas chariot was dragged away by his four steeds over the ocean krishnas and baladevas standards, which were reverently worshipped by those two heroes, were taken away by aps who day and night called upon the vrishnis and andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred water. they prepared various kinds of edibles and spirits, and set out to prabhaasa. uddhava took leave of them and krishna before departing . the vrishnis, mixing with spirits the food that had been cooked for the brahmans, gave it to apes, and began revels with drinking, so also raama, etc. yuyu dhaana blamed kritavarman for the nightly slaughter, and was applauded by pradyumna, but was rebuked by kritavarman with having killed bhurishravas while sitting in praaya krishna cast an angry glance, and saatyaki informed him of the story of the gem syamantaka, which was satraajits satyabhaamaa, weeping, approached krishna, and sitting on his lap enhanced his anger saatyaki swore that he would cause kritavarman to follow the five sons of draupadi, etc, whom he had slain with the help of ashvatthaaman, and he severed his head in the very sight of krishna, and began to strike n others krishna rushed forward to prevent him from ng further mischief, and the bhojas and andhakas all assailed him krishna did not interfere they struck yuyudhaana with the pots from which they had been eating pradyumna rushed forward to rescue yuyudhaana they were both slain. krishna in wrath took up a handful of erakaa grass, which became a terrible iron club, with which krishna slew all that came before him. the andhakas, etc also took up blades of the erakaa grass, which were converted into iron clubs, and struck one another in consequence of the curse of the brahmans son killed father and vice versa, inebriated with spirits. beholding that shaamba, etc were slain, krishna exterminated the vrishnis and the andhakas. babhru and daaruka told him now to go to raama . daaruka, krishna, and babhru, seeking raama, saw him sitting thoughtfully, reclining his back against a tree. krishna sent daaruka to inform arjuna and tell him to come quickly, and he also dispatched babhru to protect the ladies against robbers but as soon as babhru had proceeded to a distance, an iron club attached to the mallet of a hunter came and slew him. krishna then, entering dvaaravati, told his father to protect the ladies till arjuna came, saying that he would practise penances with raama. when he came to raama, the latter had applied himself to yoga, and from his mouth issued a huge white naaga with, heads and red eyes, who proceeded to the ocean, and was received by the ocean and many celestial snakes karkotaka, etc. . after raamas death krishna wandered for some time, and then sat n, thinking of gaandhaari and durvaasas, and the destruction of the vrishnis, andhakas, and kurus, whence he concluded that the hour had come he then restrained his senses though he was the supreme deity, he wished to die in order to dispel all bts, etc and to make the words of durvaasas true. the hunter jaraa, mistaking krishna for a deer, pierced him at the heel with an arrow coming up, he beheld a man dressed in yellow robes, rapt in yoga, with many arms he became filled with fear krishna comforted him and then ascended upwards, and was received in heaven by indra, etc. . meanwhile daaruka came and informed the paandavas of the slaughter of the vrishnis, etc. . arjuna with daaruka proceeded to dvaarakaa when krishnas, wives saw arjuna, they uttered a loud cry the city seemed to arjuna to be the fierce river vaitarani arjuna, satyaa, and rukmini fell n and wailed then praising krishna and comforting the ladies, arjuna went to vasudeva, whom he found lying on the ground and burning with grief vasudeva lamented and said he would die by abstaining from food . arjuna said that the hour had come for the paandavas also for departing he would, however, first remove to indraprastha the women, the children, and the aged of the vrishnis. saying to daaruka that he wished to see the chief officers of the vrishnis, arjuna entered the hall of the yaadavas called sudharmaa, where he said to the citizens and ministers that he would take away with him the remnants of the vrishnis and andhakas, as the sea would soon engulf the city vajra would be their king at indraprastha they would set out on the seventh day at sunrise. arjuna passed that night in the mansion of krishna. at dawn vasudeva by yoga attained to the highest goal the ladies were in despair. his four wives, devaki, bhadraa, rohini, and madiraa, ascended the funeral pyre, and attained to the regions of vasudeva. when arjuna had caused vasudeva and his four wives to be burnt, the boys and the ladies offered oblations of water to vasudeva. then arjuna visited the spot where the vrishnis had been killed and caused the last rites to be performed, and caused raama and krishna to be cremated. on the seventh day he set out, mounting his chariot, with the ladies and children, the yaadava troops, and other inhabitants, with krishnas, wives and vajra they numbered many millions in all. then the ocean flooded dvaarakaa. they proceeded in slow marches. when they had planted their encampment at pancanada, the aabhiras conspired to rob the cavalcade. arjuna succeeded only with great difficulty in stringing his bow his celestial weapons would not come to his mind the vrishni warriors failed to rescue the women, who were snatched away by the robbers arjunas shafts soon became exhausted formerly they had been inexhaustible. arjuna became very cheerless he escorted the remnant of the cavalcade to kurukshetra he established the son of kritavarman in the city of maarttikaavata with the remnant of the women of the bhoja king the remainder, with children and old men and women, at indraprastha, with vajra as their ruler the son of yuyudhaana on the banks of the sarasvati the wis of akrura, notwithstanding the entreaties of vajra, entered the woods rukmini, etc ascended the funeral pyre satyabhaamaa and the other wives of krishna entered the woods in order to practise penances in the contemplation of hari going beyond himavat, they took up their abode in kalaapa graama. then arjuna entered the retreat of vyaasa . asked by vyaasa, arjuna informed him of what had passed . vyaasa said that the vrishnis and andhakas had been consumed by the brahmans curse it was destiny krishna, as also the paandavas, have finished their work the time has come for your departure from the world, etc. . arjuna entered haastinapura and informed yudhishthira of what had taken place .

mrityu4, fem. naarada said to akampana in the beginning the grandsire brahmaan created all creatures. as the creation bore no sign of decay, he began to think about the destruction of the universe. failing to find any means of destruction, he became angry, and in consequence of his anger a fire sprang from the apertures of his body and destroyed all creatures. then shiva appealed to brahmaan, who said, thou hast been born out of our wish, and that the earth, afflicted with the heavy weight of creatures, had asked him to destroy them. shiva, saying that he had been appointed by brahmaan the protector of creatures, prevailed upon brahmaan to keep his wrath within his own inner self and extinguish the fire. then brahmaan expounded the trine of pravritti and nivritti. from his organs of sense then issued a female who was dark, etc and set out for the southern quarter brahmaan called her death and told her to slay the creatures. she wept, but brahmaan caught her tears with his two hands and implored her who wished to go to the hermitage of dhenuka to perform austerities to slay the creatures. soon brahmaan smiled, the creatures continued to live as before, and mrityu proceeded to dhenuka, where she practised austere vows during twenty one times ten billions of years, and then she wandered, billions of years with the creatures. next she repaired to nandaa and there passed, years, and became purified from all her sins. then she went to kaushiki, where she lived upon air and water only. then she repaired to pancagangaa and next to vetasaka, then to the gangaa and thence to meru, motionless and suspending her life breaths. thence to the top of himavat for a billion of years standing on the toe only of her feet. then to pushkara, and gokarna, and naimisha, and malaya, with steady devotion to the grandsire without acknowledging any other god. brahmaan was gratified with her and said that in slaying the creatures she should be without sin yama and the diseases should become her helpmates. she prevailed upon him that the passions, covetousness, etc should tear the bodies of the creatures before she slew them. her tears which were in his hands should become diseases springing from the creatures themselves and kill men she should be the virtue of living creatures and the goddess of this virtue. sin would slay those who were of wicked behaviour it will be thy work to sink them in their sins that are wicked. naarada further expounded the nature of death and told akampana not to grieve for his dead son, . b, .

mudgala, a rishi . vyaasa said there lived in kurukshetra a virtuous sage named mudgala, who lived by picking up ears of corn and grain, collecting a drona of corn during one fortnight and eating it together with his son and wife the other fortnight yet he celebrated the sattra called ishtikrita and the darsha and paurnamaasa sacrifices, where indra himself and the gods partook of the food offered, and entertained his guests with food, for the remainder of the drona of corn increased as soon as a guest appeared, so that hundreds of brahmans were fed with it he lived himself on the food that remained after the gods and the guests had eaten. having heard of m. durvaasas, naked and frantic, came to him uttering insulting words, and during six seasons ate up all his food, without perceiving any agitation in m.s heart. durvaasas then told m. that in reward he should go to heaven even in his own body. immediately a celestial messenger appeared upon a chariot yoked with swans and cranes, etc and invited m. to ascend it. m. first asked the devaduta to tell him about the advantages and disadvantages of heaven . the devaduta then described heaven, with its advantages myriads of beautiful worlds owned by the gods, the saadhyas, the vishve, the maharshis, the yaamas, the dhaamas, the gandharvas, and the apsarases meru extending over, yojanas the gardens of the celestials nandana, etc. no grief, etc no sweat, stench, excreta, nor urine, nor dust the foremost regions are the regions of brahmaan thither repair sanctified rishis and there dwell the ribhus, the gods of the gods themselves, who suffer no pangs from women, not possess wealth, etc not subsist on oblations nor amrita, and cannot be perceived by the senses, nor they change at the revolution of a kalpa for them there is neither ecstasy, nor joy, nor happiness, nor misery, etc. they are thirty three in number, to their regions repair wise men after having observed excellent vows, and also m. had acquired that success by his charity. its disadvantages while reaping the fruit of his acts a person cannot be engaged in any others, for this world is one of acts, the other one of fruition after one has entirely exhausted his merit, he is subject to fall he is then stupefied and agitated by emotions, and when the garlands of those who are to fall fade away, fear invades their hearts but by reason of their merits they take birth among men, and then they attain to high fortune and happiness, while, if one cannot acquire knowledge here, he comes by an inferior birth. as m. did not desire to go to heaven, but asked a region where people have not to lament nor to be pained nor agitated, the devaduta described to him the supreme seat of vishnu, which is called the highest braahman and lies above the abode of brahmaan thither only those who are free from selfishness, etc and those who are given to contemplation and yoga, can repair. then m. bade farewell to the devaduta, and being always engaged in meditation, etc he at last attained to that supreme state of perfection . therefore, vyaasa continued, you also, o son of kunti, ought not to grieve after the thirteenth year you will get back your king. having said this vyaasa returned to his hermitage to practise austerities, . b, . maudgalya.

. one when the paandavas were grieving for arjuna, bhima asked yudhishthira to permit him to go and slay duryodhana, interpreting the time to be complete, but he did not prevail upon yudhishthira. while they were conversing the great rishi brihadashva came before them, and, asked by yudhishthira if there was on earth a king more unfortunate than himself, he said that he would narrate a history of a prince more miserable than yudhishthira, viz. nala, who, defeated deceitfully by pushkara, dwelt in the woods with his spouse, having neither slaves nor chariots nor brothers nor friends with him . brihadashva said the nishadha king nala, the son of virasena, was above all kings, etc and fond of dice. the vidarbha king bhima was granted by the brahmarshi damana a daughter, damayanti, and three excellent sons, dama, daanta, and damana. both nala and damayanti had not their equals in beauty, and, continually hearing of each others virtues, they conceived attachment to each other, though they had never seen each other. once nala in his garden saw a number of golden winged swans and caught one of them, but let it loose, as it promised to speak well of him before damayanti. the swans having arrived at the vidarbha country, the one who had been caught by nala led damayanti to a secluded spot and fulfilled its mission. damayanti caused it to speak to nala of her . as damayanti became sick of love, her father invited all the kings to her svayamvara. at this time the rishis of the gods naarada and parvata, having arrived in course of their wanderings at the regions of indra, told him that the kings did not now come to him because they were intent on the svayamvara of damayanti. hearing this, the lokapaalas set out on their vehicles for the svayamvara, but seeing nala on the way and filled with astonishment at his beauty, they left their chariots in the sky and asked nala to be their messenger . nala promised to so, but when indra told him to go to damayanti and tell her that indra, agni, varuna, and yama desired her to choose one of them for her lord, he asked them to spare him as he had come with the same object but, as they insisted that he should stand by his promise, he by their power entered without being perceived by the guardians into the apartments of damayanti, and, saying his name, fulfilled his mission . damayanti declared that if she did not become the wife of nala himself she would resort to poison, or fire, or water, or the rope. nala advised her to choose one of the gods, maintaining that having come in a different mission he dared not seek his own interest. damayanti then told him to come to her svayamvara in company with the gods, then she would choose him, at which no blame would be his, and nala returned to the lokapaalas and told them what had happened . at the sacred hour of the holy lunar day of the auspicious season bhima summoned the kings to the svayamvara, and that assembly of kings resembled the bhogavati swarming with naagas. damayanti, beholding five persons all alike in appearance, and recollecting the marks of the celestials, of which she had heard from old people, was unable to distinguish which of them was nala. filled with grief, she then decided upon seeking the protection of the gods themselves, and prevailed upon them that they assumed their true shapes. thereupon she beheld the gods unmoistened with perspiration, with unwinking eyes and unfading garlands, not stained with dust, and staying without touching the ground, while nala was revealed by his sha, his fading garlands, and by his being stained with dust and sweat, and resting on the ground with winking eyes. she then chose nala, seizing the hem of his garment and placing a floral wreath round his neck. nala promised damayanti that he would remain hers as long as he lived, and she spoke words of like import to him. the lokapaalas bestowed each a couple of boons on nala indra, that he should be able to behold his divine nature in sacrifices, and blessed regions thereafter agni, his own presence wherever he wished and regions as bright as himself yama, subtle taste in food and pre eminence in virtue varuna, water wherever he desired and garlands of celestial fragrance. then the gods went to heaven and the kings returned home. nala, after the wedding, stayed there for a time, returned home, ruled righteously, and celebrated the horse sacrifice, etc. he begat the son indrasena and the daughter indrasenaa upon damayanti . when the lokapaalas were returning they met dvaapara with kali going to the svayamvara, and indra told kali that damayanti had already chosen nala. as kali threatened to avenge himself he was rebuked by the lokapaalas, as nala had studied the four vedas with the aakhyaana as the fifth, etc. when the gods had gone to heaven, kali said that he would take possession of nala and deprive him of his king, and asked dvaapara to enter the dice . kali then went to the country of the nishadhas and always watched for an opportunity. at last, in the twelfth year, when nala, after answering a call of nature, touching water had said his twilight prayers without having washed his feet, kali entered his person. then kali becoming vrisha prevailed upon pushkara, that he challenged nala to a match of dice in order to acquire his king. nala and pushkara gambled together for many months, nala being always worsted no one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading him from the play at last they came in a body, which was told by the suta to damayanti, who in vain represented it to nala he uttered not a word in reply . seeing that nala had lost everything, damayanti told her nurse and maidservant brihatsenaa to summon the councillors in the name of nala and tell them what had been lost the councillors approached nala, and damayanti informed him that the citizens had come again in a body, but he regarded her not. she then caused brihatsenaa to summon the suta vaarshneya, who at her request yoked nalas favourite horses and brought her two children to kundina . there he left the children, the chariot, and the horses, and went to ayodhyaa, where he entered the service of king rituparna as a charioteer . at last, when pushkara had won all nalas wealth and his king, he proposed to him to stake damayanti. but nala, feeling as if his heart would burst and gazing at pushkara in anguish without speaking a word, took all the ornaments off his body, and attired in a single piece of cloth left the city accompanied by damayanti. they stayed for three nights in the outskirts of the city, living on water alone. nobody showed him hospitable regards, as pushkara had proclaimed through the city that he that should show any attention to nala would be put to death. after many days nala saw some birds of golden hue and covered them with his cloth in order to catch them, but they rose up to the sky taking away that garment of his, and then told him they were the dice that had come hither to take away even his cloth. nala proposed to damayanti to leave him, pointing out to her the roads to avanti, rikshavat, vindhya, payoshni, vidarbha, koshala, and the south. but she would not leave him, but suggested that they should go to vidarbha . nala refused to appear before bhima in his state of misery. they went on attired in the same piece of cloth. once when damayanti had fallen into a profound slumber in a shed for travellers, nala, influenced by kali, resolved upon deserting damayanti, as separated from him she might perchance wander to her relatives. with a sword that he found near the shed he cut off one half of the cloth and throwing the instrument away departed, having first returned again and again, dragged away by kali, but drawn back by love . when damayanti awoke, she lamented and cursed the being through whose imprecation nala suffered woe, saying that it should lead a still more miserable life. thereupon, wandering on, she was seized by a gigantic serpent and rescued by a hunter as the hunter, after comforting her, tried to force her to love him, he was cursed by her and fell n lifeless upon the ground . description of the forest, damayantis lamentations. she went in a northerly direction for three days and nights, then she came to an asylum of ascetics, who told her that she should again become happy together with nala. then the asylum disappeared. sometime after wards, having proceeded a long way, she met with a body of merchants landing on the banks of a river its leader was shuci, and it was bound for the city of the cedi king subaahu . damayanti followed the caravan. once, at midnight, the caravan was destroyed by wild elephants and many men were trodden to death, which some ascribed to their not having worshipped manibhadra or vaishvavana, the kings of yakshas, others to their having received damayanti, whom they thought to be a raakshasa or pishaaca or yaksha woman, and resolved upon killing her when they saw her. hearing this damayanti fled. the next day the remnant of the caravan left the place. damayanti, with the brahmans that had survived the slaughter of the caravan, came towards evening to the city of the cedi king subaahu. the boys began to follow her when she came before the palace of the king, the queen mother let the nurse take her in. damayanti agreed to stay there on the conditions that she should not eat remnants, not wash anyones feet, nor speak with other men, but be protected against all aspirations. the queen gave her as a sairindhri to her daughter sunandaa . nala, having deserted damayanti, saw a conflagration in the forest and therefrom heard a voice calling him by name and saw the naaga karkotaka, who unable to stir, told him that he had deceived the great rishi naarada and been cursed by him with the words stay thou here immobile until nala takes thee hence, then thou shalt be freed from my curse, and asked him to deliver him and promised to instruct him in respect of his welfare. the snake then became as small as a thumb, and nala taking him up went to a spot free from fire. karkotaka let him proceed yet counting his steps, and bit him at the tenth step . then the form of nala was changed, in order that people might not recognize him, and karkotaka assumed his own form, and said that kali dwelling in nala should be tortured by his venom, and that nala should have no fear from animals with fangs, from enemies, and from men versed in the veda, and told him to go to ayodhyaa and present himself as a suta baahuka before rituparna, who would give nala his skill in dice in exchange for nalas knowledge of horses, and when he had become an adept at dice he should have prosperity and meet with his wife and children and regain his king. the naaga king then gave nala two pieces of celestial cloth, saying that when he desired to get back his own form he should remember him and wear this garment. then he disappeared . on the tenth day nala entered the city of rituparna he approached the king and named himself baahuka, and said that he surpassed everybody in managing steeds and might be consulted in matters of difficulty and affairs of skill, and that he was versed in the art of cooking. then he was appointed superintendent of rituparnas horses on a pay of, and vaarshneya and jivala should be under his direction. every evening he recited the shloka, where lies that helpless one afflicted with hunger and thirst and worn with toil, or upon whom s she now wait once jivala asked him who she was, and nala related to him the main features of his story without naming her or himself . bhima sent out brahmans in all directions to search for nala and damayanti, promising, kine, etc to him that should find them. at length the brahman sudeva, the friend of damayantis brother, recognized damayanti in the city of the cedis, seated with sunandaa during the time of the kings prayers, and told her who he was and that her relatives and children were well. beholding damayanti weeping and conversing in private with sudeva, sunandaa caused her mother to question sudeva . sudeva told the story of damayanti, and that he had recognized her by a mole between her eyebrows, which was now almost covered with dust as her whole body. then sunandaa washed away the dust and the queen mother recognized her by the mole as the daughter of her sister, as she and damayantis mother were both daughters of the dashaarna king sudaaman, and she herself had been bestowed on virabaahu and her sister on bhima she had witnessed damayantis birth in the palace of her father in the dashaarna country. at her own request damayanti was brought in a litter carried by men and protected by a large escort to the city of bhima, and was received with respect and worshipped the gods and brahmans. bhima gave unto sudeva, kine, etc. the next day damayanti let her mother cause bhima to send brahmans out in all directions to seek for nala. damayanti ordered them everywhere to recite the shlokas o beloved gambler, where hast thou gone, cutting off half of my garment, etc but to take care that no one knew that it was on her command . after a long time the brahman parnaada told that he had in ayodhyaa visited bhaangaasuri, and that baahuka had been affected by hearing his shloka, and had said to him chaste women, though overtaken by calamity, yet protect themselves, etc. damayanti then thanked parnaada and promised him great wealth and consulted with her mother, and, without bhimas knowing it, sent sudeva, who told rituparna that to morrow damayanti would hold another svayamvara . when ordered by rituparna to conduct him to the svayamvara of damayanti, baahuka felt his heart bursting with grief, but promised to go there in a single day he yoked four horses born in sindhu, made vaarshneya sit on the chariot, and set out with so great speed that vaarshneya thought he must be maatali or shaalihotra, who had taken a human shape, or nala . as the chariot was coursing thus, rituparna lost his upper garment, and nala declared that it was impossible to recover it, as they had already travelled one yojana thence. as rituparna rightly indicated the number of fruits of a vibhitaka tree, and said he was skilled in dice as in numbers, nala prevailed upon him to teach him the science and in future receive instead his science of horses. then kali came out from the body of nala, vomiting the poison of karkotaka, and assumed his own shape, as the fire of damayantis curse had left him, but remained invisible to others except nala. kali prevailed upon nala that he should not curse him, promising that those men who would attentively recite his history should be free from fear of him, and entered the vibhitaka tree till nala had gone far away. then kali returned to his abode. from the touch of kali the vibhitaka tree from that hour fell into disrepute. nala now became free from calamity, though he did not assume his original form . at night they arrived at kundina, having passed yojanas. the steeds of nala that were in that city, and peacocks and elephants and damayanti recognized the sound of nalas chariot damayanti ascended the terrace with the desire of seeing nala. the koshala king wondered, as he did not hear any talk of the svayamvara, etc and bhima thought that he had come simply to pay his respects. when rituparna had gone to his appointed quarters with vaarshneya, and baahuka, having tended the horses, was sitting at the side of the chariot, damayanti sent a female messenger in search of nala . the female messenger keshini asked baahuka about vaarshneya and himself he said that vaarshneya was the charioteer of nala, that nobody knew nala except nala himself and his wife, as he did not discover his marks of identity anywhere, and that he himself was the charioteer and cook of king rituparna at last she repeated the shloka of parnaada o beloved gambler, etc and said that damayanti wished again to hear the reply he had given parnaada then baahuka, weeping, said chaste women, though overtaken by calamity, etc and keshini went to damayanti and acquainted her with everything . damayanti again sent keshini to stay in silence at baahukas side and mark his conduct she related that low passages grew in height so that he might pass through them easily, that when he approached narrow holes opened wide, that only by his looking upon them the vessels became filled with water, that when he held a handful of grass in the sun the fire blazed up all of a sudden, that he touched fire and was not hurt, that water falling at his will flowed in a stream, and that flowers pressed with his hands became gayer and more fragrant than before. damayanti then caused keshini without baahukas knowledge to bring her some meat that had been boiled and dressed by him, from the kitchen, and recognized the taste. she then sent her two children with keshini. baahuka embraced them crying aloud, saying they were like his own children, and sent keshini away lest people might think evil . having obtained the consent both of her father and mother, damayanti caused nala to be brought to her apartments it came to an explication damayanti declared that she had feigned to hold a second svayamvara because no one except nala could in one day manage yojanas with horses, and swore by the air, sun, and moon, who had been her protector for these three years, and vaayu bore witness to the truth of her words. then a floral shower fell there, and the celestial kettledrum began to play. nala then wore the garment he had received from the serpent king and regained his old form. thus nala in the fourth year was reunited with his wife . the next day they presented themselves before bhima. the citizens were in great joy and aned the temples, etc. rituparna asked nalas forgiveness, and nala also asked rituparnas forgiveness, and made over to him his horse lore, having obtained from him the mystery of dice. then rituparna went away to his own city, employing another person as his charioteer . having dwelt for a month at kundina, nala set out for the nishadha country with a single white chariot, sixteen elephants, fifty horses, and infantry, and proposed to pushkara that they should gamble again, as nala had won great wealth the stake should be damayanti, wealth and king, and their lives if not, he proposed a single combat. pushkara, hoping to win damayanti, whom he loved, gladly consented to gamble, and lost at a single throw. nala, declaring that it was kali who had e it all, forgave his brother and granted him his portion, and after a month let him go to his own town. all the citizens and subjects rejoiced at nalas return . then nala with a large force brought damayanti and his children home, and passed his days in joy and performed numerous sacrifices with abundant gifts to brahmans. so thou also, o yudhishthira, wilt blaze forth in effulgence soon. they that will repeatedly recite this history of nala and they that will hear it recited will never be touched by adversity. as yudhishthira feared that some one skilled in dice might summon him, brihadashva taught him the science of dice and then went to ashvashiras for a bathe. yudhishthira then learnt from brahmans and ascetics from various directions that arjuna was still engaged in ascetic penances, and yudhishthira grieved for him .

. b ri. naarada and his sisters son parvata had in days of old left heaven for a pleasant ramble on earth in order to taste clarified butter and rice. they wandered under a compact of telling each other their inmost thoughts. they arrived at the court of srinjaya . naarada was taken with the charms of srinjayas daughter sukumaari but shamefulness prevented him from disclosing his love to parvata, who then cursed him for his reticence, saying that sukumaari should become his wife, but then she and every man should behold him in the shape of an ape. naarada cursed parvata in return, saying that he should not succeed in proceeding to heaven. parvata began to wander over the earth. sukumaari beheld naarada as an ape, but devoted herself entirely to him, and did not desire any mu or y. for a husband. naarada and parvata, after some time, became reconciled and withdrew their mutual curses. sukumaari fled, thinking naarada to be somebody else, but was informed by parvata. parvata proceeded to heaven and naarada to his home. krishna continued ri. naarada is here he will tell thee everything that happened .

susharman with the remnant of the samshaptakas. only ashvatthaaman did not flee ashvatthaaman shikhandin, etc. . ashvatthaaman asked duryodhana why the troops were fleeing away, even karnas troops duryodhana caused kripa to inform ashvatthaaman of the truth, at which ashvatthaaman was filled with rage . dhritaraashtra asked sanjaya what ashvatthaaman said, he who knew the weapons of men and vaaruna, etc. . sanjaya related ashvatthaaman complained before duryodhana that his father has been killed, and vowed to destroy the paancaalas and the paandavas neither nor g as u raa etc were able to vanquish him there were none equal to him and arjuna in knowledge of weapons he had a weapon that neither arjuna, etc. knew, given by naaraayana to his father as a boon, with the promise that no

once more advance to battle, rallied by ashvatthaaman. sanjaya related yudhishthira spoke about the matter to arjuna, fearing that it was indra himself who was approaching for the sake of the kauravas. arjuna in reply described the prowess of ashvatthaaman and the unrighteousness of the paandavas in slaying drona all of us have passed the greater part of our lives the days that remain to us are few this exceedingly unrighteous act has stained that remnant did not interfere, as he was about to be slain for this fault have already sunk into hell, overcome with shame . bhimasena,

ashamed saatyaki wrathfully rebuked dhrishtadyumna . dhrishta dyumna in reply taunted saatyaki with the slaughter of bhurishrasas . saatyaki rushed towards dhrishtadyumna in order to slay him bhima, urged by krishna, held him back sahadeva endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation dhrishtadyumna asked bhima to let him slay saatyaki then he or arjuna would slay the enemies. krishna and yudhishthira restored peace with great difficulty, and all the warriors proceeded to battle . ashvatthaaman caused a great carnage among the paandava troops before duryodhana he repeated his vow . duryodhana rallied his troops. ashvatthaaman invoked the naaraayana weapon . the paandavas, etc became exceedingly agitated. yudhishthira, relying on krishna, advised dhrishtadyumna to flee away with his paancaalas, and saatyaki with the vrishnis and andhakas he and his brothers would ascend a funeral pile . krishna prevailed upon the troops to lay n their weapons and alight from their chariots. bhimasena alone refused to so, and dissuaded the others . arjuna said that his vow was that the gaandiva should not be used against the naaraayana weapon, kine, and brahmans. bhima attacked ashvatthaaman, but was overwhelmed by the energy of the naaraayana weapon . arjuna covered bhimasena with the vaaruna weapon, arjuna and krishna, alighting from their chariot, proceeded on foot towards bhima and forcibly brought him n from his chariot, making him aban his weapons. then the naaraayana weapon became neutralized all the quarters became clear, etc. the paandava host stood arrayed once more. duryodhana urged ashvatthaaman to use the same weapon once more ashvatthaaman said that it could not be used twice if brought back it would without bt slay himself. duryodhana then urged him to slay the enemies with other weapons. dhritaraashtra asked, what then came to pass sanjaya related dhrishtadyumna ashvatthaaman, who deprived dhrishtadyumna of his steeds, driver, and chariot the paancaalas fled away. saatyaki ashvatthaaman, who was worsted by him. duryodhana, etc saatyaki, who made them flee away deprived of their chariots. ashvatthaaman saatyaki, who once more

carried away by his steeds the paancaalas fled away . arjuna ashvatthaaman arjuna addressed ashvatthaaman in harsh words . dhritaraashtra asked sanjaya about the cause of this, as arjuna and ashvatthaaman loved each other. sanjaya said that it was in consequence of his grief . ashvatthaaman became angry with arjuna and especially with krishna, touched water, and made use of the aagneya weapon, from which dire omens in nature appeared, and a great slaughter in the paandava army resulted raa. and psh. uttered fierce cries, etc. . arjuna invoked the braahma weapon the darkness was dispelled, etc. a full akshauhini of the paandava troops had been killed krishna and arjuna were unwounded the paandavas rejoiced, the kauravas wondered, ashvatthaaman was disconsolate, and ran away from the fight he met vyaasa, and asked him the reason neither as nor g psh raa u y and birds, nor men can baffle this weapon. vyaasa told him the story of naaraayana nara and naaraayana are arjuna and krishna even ashvatthaa man has been born as a portion of rudra, and was endued with great wis, regarding the universe to consist only of mahaadeva, etc and shiva had granted him numerous boons, and he had, in every yuga, aed the great god in his phallic form. krishna had sprung from rudra himself, and always worshipped him, regarding his phallic emblem as the origin of the universe, and he viewed the identity of braahman with the universe si and m. ri. ae krishna in order to attain to mahaadeva krishna is the creator of everything the eternal krishna should be aed with sacrifices, etc. ashvatthaaman bowed unto rudra, regarded krishna as worthy of the highest regards, and became filled with delight, the marks whereof appeared on his body. bowing to vyaasa, he caused the army to be withdrawn, and so did also the paandavas. having fought for five days.. drona repaired to brahmaloka . arjuna met with vyaasa and inquired of him about the invisible person who aided him in the battle vyaasa said that it was mahaadeva himself, and recited a long enumeration of his attributes if mahaadeva becomes angry, neither nor as g raa even if they hide themselves in deep caves, can have peace. in days of yore mahaadeva destroyed the sacrifice of daksha the sacrifice fled away, and . and as. fell n and submitted to mahaadeva, the naagas and ri. became agitated, etc. pushan was eating the purodaasha shiva tore out his teeth the gods assigned to rudra a substantial share in sacrifices he then re established the sacrifice. then vyaasa related the destruction of tripura . he is rudra,

one when the paarthas were thinking of arjuna, they saw indras chariot, driven by maatali, illuminating the sky, and arjuna descended and saluted each of them maatali also greeted and instructed them, and then returned in the chariot to indra. arjuna then gave to draupadi precious gems, etc presented to him by indra. then he related all as it had happened, and slept that night with the two sons of maadri . the next morning indra visited them under the sound of musical instruments, etc and blessed yudhishthira, and advised him to repair to kaamyaka. blessing upon the reader . when indra had gone, arjuna related his journey from kaamyaka, etc. . arjuna continued his narrative he passed the night after the meeting with the kiraata at that place, and in the morning he saw again the same brahman, and in the evening he had the visit of the lokapaalas the weapons that indra promised to teach him were those of vaayu, agni, the vasus, varuna, the maruts, the saadhya and paitaamaha weapons, those of the gandharvas, uragas, and raakshasas, and all the vaishnava and nairrita weapons in the chariot of indra, maatali wondered that arjuna was not jerked, though indra always himself gets jerked at the first pull by the steeds when he had learnt the weapons, indra said that now even the gods could not conquer him he had received knowledge of fifteen weapons with five modes of using them, viz. prayoga, upasamhaara, aavritti, praayashcitta, and pratighaata indra asked him, as his fee, to slay the nivaatakavacas, who were thirty millions in number and dwelt in the ocean, and gave him the chariot, upon which he had vanquished bali, shambara, bala, vritra, prahlaada, and naraka, and millions of daityas, and this diadem, and ornaments like his own, and the impenetrable mail, and fastened this durable string to the gaandiva, and the gods gave him the shell devadatta, through which indra had conquered the worlds . arjuna continued when he came to the ocean, he saw at a short distance the daitya city filled with daanavas. maatali drove the chariot with force, and the daanavas shut the gates. then arjuna blew the devadatta, and the nivaatakavacas appeared with iron javelins, maces, clubs, hatchets, sabres, discs, shataghnis, bhushundis, and swords, and sounded dissonant musical instruments. the devarshis, the daanavarshis, the brahmarshis, and the siddhas came to the battle . with arrows inspired with mantras relating to the brahman weapon, then with the maadhava weapon and the gaandiva arjuna killed innumerable nivaatakavacas, and the, horses yoked at the chariot conducted by maatali trampled upon them . arjuna reduced a shower of crags to powder by the mahendra weapon, then dried up showers of water by the weapon vishoshana, that he had acquired from indra then he annihilated fire by the water weapon, and by the stone weapon he repeatedly resisted the wind. then darkness enveloped the world the steeds turned away, maatali fell off, and the golden lash fell from his hand as maatali was stupefied, a terrible fear seized arjuna maatali said that he had conducted indras chariot in the battle for the sake of nectar, and in the battles with shambara, vritra, vairocani, etc but never had he lost his senses before. arjuna comforted maatali and repeatedly frustrated the magic of the enemy, and maatali again conducted the chariot. then on a sudden arjuna did not see the daanavas, who had become hidden by illusion . arjuna then fought with invisible weapons. then they withdrew the illusion and entered their city. the fallen and their weapons covered the ground so that the horses had to proceed in the sky. the nivaatakavacas remaining invisible, covered the welkin with crags others, entering into the earth, seized the legs of the horses and the wheels of the chariot. arjuna became distressed, but being advised by maatali, he applied the thunderbolt, inspiring the gaandiva with mantras, so that the arrows sent by the thunderbolt, becoming thunderbolts, penetrated the illusions and killed the nivaatakavacas. while the wives of daanavas were bewailing and at last fled to their palaces, arjuna and maatali entered the city, that was superior to that of the gods . maatali told him that this was originally the city of indra, but the gods had been driven away from it by the nivaatakavacas, who had through austerities gratified pitaamaha and obtained from him the boons, that they might reside here and be free from danger from the gods. when indra applied to svayambhu, he was told that he himself in another body should destroy them. as the gods were unable to slay them, indra had given those weapons to arjuna, so that he might destroy them, then arjuna and maatali again went to the abode of the gods . while returning he beheld a celestial city, moving at will, with trees of gems, etc with four gates, etc and maatali told him it was hiranyapura, made by brahmaan himself for the great asuras, the paulomas, and kaalakanjas, as the daiteyi pulomaa and the mahaasuri kaalakaa had by practising austerities for, celestial years obtained from svayambhu that their offspring should suffer little misfortune, be incapable of being killed by gods, and obtain an aërial, etc city, invincible even by the gods, maharshis, yakshas, gandharvas, pannagas, asuras, and raakshasas. brahmaan had destined that arjuna, a mortal, should kill them. therefore destroy them with the thunderbolt. a battle ensued the asuras resorted to illusion the city now entered into the earth, and now it rose upwards, etc. shot with the iron shafts of arjuna the city fell n. then they environed him in, chariots, etc. arjuna applied to rudra, and seeing a man with three heads, nine eyes, etc he applied the raudra weapon to the gaandiva when it had been hurled, there appeared forms of deer, lions, tigers, garudas, gandharvas, yakshas, asuras, guhyakas, nairritas, yaatudhaanas, etc by thousands. the daanavas, some of whom had three heads, some four tusks, etc were destroyed. arjuna again worshipped tripuraghna . maatali rejoiced and praised arjuna. the wives of the daanavas came out of the city bewailing the slain. maatali took arjuna to the abode of indra, and related in detail to indra arjunas achievement, and indra with the maruts praised him, and said that gods, daanavas, raakshasas, yakshas, asuras, gandharvas, birds, and serpents should not be able to resist him in fight, etc. . indra said that on the battlefield bhishma, drona, kripa, karna, shakuni, etc should not amount to part of arjuna. then indra gave him this golden garland, the shell devadatta, etc. . then indra told him to depart, and thus after five years come to you on the summit of this lower range of gandhamaadana . having promised that he should in the next morning show yudhishthira all the celestial weapons, arjuna passed that night there with all his brothers . the next morning, when arjuna was about to show the celestial weapons to yudhishthira, the earth trembled, etc. the brahmarshis, siddhas, maharshis, devarshis, gods, yakshas, raakshasas, gandharvas, etc pitaamaha, the lokaapaalas, and mahaadeva with his ganas appeared vaayu threw celestial garlands, sent by the gods, on arjuna, the gandharvas chanted ballads, and apsarases danced and sent by the gods naarada came and prevailed upon arjuna not to use the celestial weapons without necessity, as they would destroy the three worlds. then the gods, etc went whence they had come, and the paandavas pleasantly dwelt in that same forest with krishnaa .

. asked by yudhishthira, maarkandeya related, on account of krishnaa the madra king ashvapati, the husband of maalavi, was old and childless. after eighteen years of vows and offerings to saavitri, saavitri granted him a boon he asked for many sons, but was promised a daughter. she was called saavitri. as nobody asked her in marriage, she was sent to look for a husband herself . she chose satyavat, the son of the shaalva king dyumatsena, who had been blinded and deprived of his king and lived as an ascetic in the forest. satyavat equalled rantideva saankrti, shibi aushinara, yayaati, etc but naarada said within a year of this day he will die then naarada went to heaven . after her marriage saavitri dressed in bark garments, etc. . she counted the days, and having ascertained that her husband would die on the fourth day following, she observed a triraatra vow on the fourth day all the ascetics uttered benedictions that she should never suffer wihood she would not eat before the sun set. she followed satyavat as he, taking his axe, set out for the woods . he fell ill and slept with his head on her lap. yama himself and not his emissary came with a noose in his hand and pulled out of the body of satyavat a person of the size of a thumb, bound it in the noose and proceeded in a southern direction. saavitri followed him and was granted five boons that her father in law should attain his eye sight and be strong that her father in law should regain his king and never fall off from his duties that her father should have sons that she and satyavat should have sons begotten from both of us that satyavat should be restored to life and live years. yama untied the noose she went back to the corpse and placed his head on her lap. satyavat regained his consciousness. he was anxious about his parents, and they returned to the hermitage . meanwhile dyumatsena had regained his sight, but was anxious at not finding satyavat. he was comforted by the brahmans suvarcas, gautama, bharadvaaja, daalbhya, apastamba, and dhaumya. a little while afterwards satyavat and saavitri reached the hermitage. saavitri narrated every thing that had happened and was praised by the rishis . meanwhile the enemy of dyumatsena had been slain by his minister, and dyumatsena then again became king of the shaalvas. saavitri after a long time gave birth to sons, and her father also got sons by maalavi. so also krishnaa will rescue ye all. yudhishthira and his brothers continued to live in the kaamyaka forest .

and . questioned by yudhishthira about the virtue of women, maarkandeya, saying that the work of a mother is more difficult than that of a father, and that for women neither sacrifices nor shraaddhas nor fasts are of any efficacy, but that they can win heaven only by serving their husbands, related when the brahman kaushika, who had studied the vedas and the upanishads, was reciting the vedas under a tree, a female crane befouled his body, and looked upon with anger by kaushika fell to the ground. kaushika regretted his angry deed. when he had entered a village in order to procure alms, in a certain house the wife first served her husband, who came home tired and hungry, with food, etc and then began to conciliate the angry kaushika, who blamed her for exalting her husband above the brahmans. she said that she was no she crane, that she knew that the ocean had been made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the brahmans, that the fire of their wrath had not to this day been extinguished in the forest of dandaka, but that she regarded her husband as her supreme god, and deserved forgiveness, that anger is a foe to men within themselves, and that the gods know him to be a brahman who has abaned anger and passion, etc. and who, though himself injured, never returns the injury, etc that virtue is difficult to understand, but must be based on truth the ancients have declared that virtue depends on shruti, but it is variously defined and subtle to be understood thou art cognisant of virtue and studiest the vedas but think, however, that thou t not know what virtue really is a fowler in mithilaa will discourse to thee on virtue. kaushika blessed her, and returned to his abode, reproaching himself . he set out for mithilaa, ruled over by janaka, and found out the fowler, who was seated in a butchers yard, selling venison and buffalo meat to a large crowd of buyers but he at once went to kaushika, and proving that he knew why he had come, he led him to his abode, where he honoured him duly, and explained to him that, notwithstanding his cruel trade, which he had inherited from his sires and grandsires, and which belonged to his caste by birth, he led a virtuous life, serving his superiors and old people, speaking truth, never envying others, giving to the best of his power, etc. in the king of janaka there did not exist a single subject that did not follow the duties of his caste. he did not slay the boars and buffaloes himself, nor did he eat meat himself he fasted during the day and ate in the night even though the behaviour of his order be bad, a person may yet be himself of good behaviour so also a person may become virtuous, although he may by profession be a slayer of animals. it is the fault of the kings when the subjects decay, and monsters, dwarfs, etc are produced, but janaka ruled justly. if one repents a wrong e by him, he is delivered from his sin . if a man seeks redemption after having committed a sin, he becomes purified of all his sins . it is temptation that constitutes the basis of sin. then he gave some advice as to what is virtuous conduct . the fowler and the animals slain by him are driven by their karman in a former life. in days of yore, animals and, cows used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king rantideva at the caaturmaasya animals are sacrificed the shruti says, the fires are fond of meat, and at the sacrifices animals are killed by the regenerate, and these animals are purged of sin, and by mantras go to heaven. regarding animal food this rule has been laid n by munis whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the pitris, is not polluted by the act. the shruti says, such a man is not one who partakes of animal food, and a brahman who has intercourse with his wife during her season is a brahma caarin. king saudaasa, under the influence of a curse, ate human flesh. agriculture is considered to be praiseworthy, though the plough destroys many creatures. seeds of rice, etc are all living creatures. as to hunting and the cutting of trees and herbs, many creatures live in trees and fruits and water. the earth and the air are all swarming with living organisms, which are unconsciously destroyed by men from mere ignorance . when life is at stake and in the matter of marriage, it is justified to tell an untruth. whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is considered to be truth . the fowler discoursed upon the influence of karman upon metempsychosis and salvation . questioned by kaushika about the senses, the fowler discoursed about the sinful . the virtuous man discerns these evils by means of his spiritual insight . then he shortly enumerated the elements of the braahmi vidyaa

pratijnaaparvan . in the evening, when arjuna having slain large numbers of samshaptakas, pro ceeded towards his tent, he said to krishna that his heart was affrighted he noticed indications of disaster abhimanyu did not come out with smiles to receive him, etc. he remembered that drona had this day formed the circular army, which none save abhimanyu could break, but he had not taught him how to come out of it, after having pierced it he had heard the leonine shouts of the dhaartaraashtras, and krishna had heard yuyutsu censuring them for having slain a child instead of arjuna, and then yuyutsu had thrown away his weapons afflicted with rage and grief. krishna con soled arjuna, referring to the kshatriya duties and heaven. none save krishna and yudhishthira could address arjuna. yudhishthira, addressing him, told him the particulars of abhimanyus heroism and fall. arjuna vowed to slay jayadratha before the setting of the morrows sun even as to as men, birds, snakes, p wanderers of the night, b. ri . ri etc he said that they would not succeed in protecting him, even if he entered rasaatala, or ascended the firmament, or repaired to the city of the gods or the city of diti if the sun set before he had slain him, he would himself ascend the pyre. arjuna bent the gaandiva, krishna blew the paancajanya, arjuna the devadatta . having been informed by spies, jayadratha was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear, thinking that not even drona, etc not even g as u raa can protect him against arjuna he wished to return home. duryodhana comforted him, saying that he, karna, etc would protect him. jayadratha, accompanied by duryodhana, repaired that very night to drona and questioned him about the difference between himself and arjuna. drona said they had got the same instruction, but arjuna was superior to jayadratha in consequence of yoga and the hard life led by arjuna drona would, however, protect him, forming an impenetrable array and, moreover, death ought not to be an object of terror to him . krishna remonstrated with arjuna for his rash vow the kurus had expected an attack by arjuna now they will protect jayadratha karna, etc. would be in jayadrathas van dronas army would be half a shakata and half a lotus with a needle mouthed array in the middle . arjuna assured krishna of his competence to accomplish his vow, notwithstanding drona, saa r a m with indra, . p g garuda, etc by the means of gaandiva and the weapons he had obtained from yama, etc and the braahma weapon . the gods with indra became very anxious. sinister omens appeared in nature. krishna went to arjunas abode and comforted subhadraa . subhadraa lamented over abhimanyu, and said fie on bhimasena, etc because they had not protected him. draupadi and uttaraa came to her, lamenting krishna said that abhimanyu had obtained the most laudable and enviable goal. then he returned to arjuna . arjuna performed his usual nightly sacrifice to shiva. krishna with daaruka repaired to his own tent. none in the paandava camp slept that night, thinking of arjuna. in the middle of the night krishna said to daaruka that he had resolved to fight to morrow he should equip his chariot, placing on it kaumodaki, etc making room for garuda, and yoking thereto balaahaka, etc. when hearing pancajanya emitting the shrill rishabha note, he should come to krishna . arjuna in a dream saw krishna, who told him not to grieve, and mentioned the paashupata weapon if he remembered it now, he would be able to slay jayadratha to morrow otherwise he should pray to shiva. at the braahma hour, arjuna saw himself sojourning through the sky manimat, frequented by si. and caa etc. with krishna, to where shiva was seated with paarvati krishna and arjuna hymned mahaadeva . arjuna saw that the offerings he had made every night to krishna had come to shiva, and he mentally worshipped both krishna and shiva. shiva then told krishna and arjuna where to fetch his bow and arrow from a lake of amrita. in the lake they saw two terrible snakes when they had uttered the brahma shatarudriya, the snakes assumed the forms of a bow and arrow. from shivas body there came out a brahmacaarin of blue throat and red locks, and having showed arjuna the use of the bow and arrow, and the mantras, he sped these weapons to that same lake. having thus once more obtained the paashupata weapon, arjuna with krishna came back to their own camp . the four teenth day. yudhishthira underwent his morning rites krishna visited yudhishthira . then also viraata, etc came . yudhishthira asked krishna to rescue the paandavas, quoting naarada. krishna assured yudhishthira of arjunas success . arjuna came and acquainted yudhishthira of his dream. then he and krishna and yuyudhaana set out to arjunas pavilion. krishna equipped arjunas chariot, which arjuna circumambulated, bow and arrows in hand. arjuna, yuyu dhaana, and krishna mounted the chariot. many auspicious omens appeared. arjuna charged yuyudhaana to protect yudhishthira in his absence . yuyudhaana proceeded to yudhishthira .

and battled with his sinful kinsfolk times . vyaasa dissuaded yudhishthira from a life of retirement and commended a life of esticity, quoting a verse of brihaspati, and reciting the story of r. ri. sudyumna the brothers shankha and likhita dwelled in two separate dwellings on the banks of baahudaa once, when shankha had gone out, likhita came to his asylum and ate many ripe fruits. shankha told him to confess to the king and ask him to inflict on him the punishment of a thief. king sudyumna would par him but likhita would not sudyumna then caused his hands to be cut off likhita, having asked par of shankha, was told by him to gratify ri and p. at baahudaa, upon which two hands grew out. shankha said that he was not his chastiser, but the king has been himself purified, as also thyself,

monarchs of old, especially hayagriva . hearing the words of vyaasa and seeing arjuna angry, yudhishthira declared to vyaasa that earthly rule could give him no delight. vyaasa answered, pointing out the virtues of time, quoting the old story recited by king senajit in grief. engaging in battle has been said to be the sacrifice for a king a due observance of the science of chastisement is his yoga and the gift of wealth in sacrifices in the shape of dakshinaa is his renunciation all this should be regarded as acts that sanctify him . yudhishthiras reply to arjuna recommending a life of yoga and austerities this is the practice of r regarded by . as brahmans this is the opinion of the vaikhaanasas the ajaa, etc. have all gone to heaven by means of vedic study by performing the acts indicated in the vedas, battle, sacrifices, study of the vedas, restrainment of passion, one goes to heaven by the southern path of the sun the northern path is travelled by those devoted to yoga, and is much

he caused of his kinsmen bhishma had, by the energy of his weapons, burnt ugraayudha, etc. vyaasa comforted yudhishthira by explaining the action of destiny, and exhorted him to work . vyaasa recited the old story, that is known by the name of ashmans discourse the videha king janaka, filled with sorrow, questioned the wise brahman ashman as to how a man should behave upon occasions of the accession and the destruction of both kinsmen and wealth. ashman said that destiny and time are inevitable no person can see either heaven or hell the scriptures, however, are the eyes of the virtuous frame thy conduct according to the scriptures. janaka became freed from grief enjoy the earth, o son of kunti . arjuna asked krishna to dispel yudhishthiras grief. krishna asked yudhi shthira not to grieve for men who died heroically in battle in the observance of kshatriya duties, quoting the shodasharaajopaa khyaana, i.e. the old discourse of naarada before srinjaya when the latter was deeply afflicted with grief on account of the death of his son. srinjaya was freed from grief, and naarada gave back to him his son suvarnashthivin, whom parvata had given him, and who had been bereft of life that child should live, years . requested by yudhishthira, krishna told naarada parvatopaakhyaana . thereafter naarada told suvarnasthivi sambhavopaakhyaana . vyaasa exhorted yudhishthira to shake off his grief and assume the reins of sovereignty. yudhishthira feared that the guilt of slaughter had stained him vyaasa repeated his observations on destiny as yudhishthira still was remorseful, vyaasa repeated his observations on time, and pointed to expiatory rites, illustrating the case by the war of, years, by which the gods, having slain dai gained possession of heaven, and slew, brahmans called shaalaavrikaa who had joined the daa. thou hast only followed the path formerly trodden by the very gods men like you never go to hell. he recommended a horse sacrifice as an expiation, mentioning that indra, assisted by the maruts, gradually performed sacrifices and became shatakratu, and is aed in the heavens by aps ri and . . vyaasa discoursed on expiation and indicated the acts for which there should be expiation, citing the sage uddaalaka, who caused his son shvetaketu to be begotten by disciple, etc and declared that by penances, religious rites, and gifts one may wash off sins if one s not commit them anew, and indicated diverse kinds of expiation for diverse kinds of sins . asked by yudhishthira, vyaasa declared what food is clean and what is unclean . yudhishthira desired to hear of the duties of kings and of the four different orders. vyaasa, casting his eyes on naarada, directed yudhishthira to apply to bhishma for discourses on kingly duties, as bhishma, having gratified . ri. with brih, at their head, had acquired a knowledge of the duties of kings, and of that science, with its interpretations, that ushanas and brihaspati know and a knowledge of all the vedas with their branches, from vasishtha and cyavana of bhrigus race in olden days he studied under sanatkumaara he learned the duties of the yatis from maarkandeya and obtained all weapons from raama and indra although childless, yet he has many regions of bliss before himself b. ri. were always his courtiers. yudhishthira was ashamed to approach bhishma. krishna exhorted yudhishthira to rise up, shaking off his grief . thus addressed by krishna, etc yudhi shthira gave up his grief and anxiety, and with his brothers and the other kings, headed by dhritaraashtra, set out for haastinapura. the procession described . the citizens welcomed yudhishthira and draupadi, etc. . yudhi shthira entered the palace with dhaumya and dhritaraashtra, and was blessed by the brahmans, but cursed by caarvaaka, a raa. who had disguised himself as a brahman, and a friend of duryodhana the brahmans killed caarvaaka by uttering the mere sound hum . krishna related in the krita age raa. caarvaaka performed penances in badari at last he solicited from brahmaan the boon of immunity from fear at the hands of every being in the universe, which brahmaan granted him, only with the limitation that he should be careful not to offend brahmans. then he began to cause trouble to the gods brahmaan predicted caarvaakas friendship with duryodhana, and that he would insult the brahmans . the ceremony of yudhishthiras installation on the throne described he made gifts to the brahmans, who all blessed him and his brothers . yudhishthira answered and enjoined respect for his aged uncle, disposed of the high appointments of state, and caused the obsequial rites to be performed in honour of the slaughtered heroes, and performed acts of kindness to the ladies, wied in the battle, the destitute, the blind, and helpless . then he aed krishna, and assigned to his brothers proper residences from among the palaces of the kuru princes slain in battle . they passed a happy night in their respective abodes, and in the morning presented themselves before king yudhishthira . yudhishthiras gifts to diverse persons . then he addressed krishna, whom he found rapt in meditation he uttered a hymn to krishna, who awoke and praised bhishma, asking yudhishthira to resort to bhishma for instruction. yudhishthira requested krishna to grant bhishma the sight of his divine person. krishna caused saatyaki to let daaruka yoke his chariot with sugriva and shaibya, etc. . descrip tion of the bed of arrows on which bhishma lay, surrounded by ri. vyaasa, etc. . bhishma hymned krishna . krishna moved by bhishmas aations, bestowed upon him heavenly knowledge compassing the past, the present, and the future, and went away. those holy brahmans aed bhishma and krishna. seeing the devotion of bhishma, krishna suddenly rose from his seat and ascended his chariot with saatyaki yudhishthira and arjuna mounted another bhimasena and the twins a third kripa, yuyutsu, and sanjaya on their respective chariots . then krishna, etc proceeded to kurukshetra . krishna pointed out to yudhishthira the five lakes of raama bhaargava. requested by yudhishthira, krishna related raamopaakhyaana . then he proceeded quietly in his chariot . yudhishthiras eulogy of raama . beholding from a distance the spot on which bhishma lay, yudhishthira, etc descended from their chariots and approached and saluted the ri. . seeing bhishma on the point of death, krishna addressed him kindly, and eulogized him . bhishma saluted krishna, and beheld his eternal form. krishna said that it was owing to bhishmas devotion that he had displayed his celestial form to him those regions, o king are ready for thee whence there is no return fifty six days still remain for thee to live when surya turns to his northerly course, you shall go there . and riding on their chariots, are waiting for thee invisibly. krishna asked bhishma to instruct yudhishthira, etc. when thou wilt leave this world for that, all knowledge will expire with thee . bhishma alleged physical weakness and mental darkness as reasons for his inability to obey krishna, and he also hesitated to speak in krishnas presence. krishna removed bhishmas pain and granted him power to recollect everything and behold the universe like a fish in a limpid stream. m. ri. with vyaasa aed krishna with words, accompanied by ric, yojus, and saaman verses celestial flowers fell, and aps. sang, etc. at sunset the m. ri rising up, saluted krishna, bhishma, and yudhishthira. upon this, krishna, returned to haastinapura, after having saluted bhishma, saying that they would return next day . krishna passed the night happily, performed his morning rites, and was welcomed with music and song at early dawn asked by krishna, saatyaki saw yudhishthira and apprised him of krishnas readiness to accompany him into the presence of bhishma. yudhishthira asked arjuna to see that his chariot was made ready then he, with the

alighting from their chariots, saluted ri. by raising their right hands. yudhishthira approached bhishma, eying him timidly . many ri. and saa etc came to bhishma. naarada urged the paandavas to take advantage of the short span of life still left to bhishma for soliciting him to discourse on morality. yudhishthira requested krishna to put questions to bhishma. bhishmas cheerful answer. he enquired of krishna why he was desired to discourse on morality and the duties of kings, krishnas divine self being best fitted to so krishna explained that his motive was only the enhancement of bhishmas glory thou hast always worshipped ri. and . . bhishma consented to discourse on morality and duty, and desired yudhishthira to question him. krishna introduced yudhishthira to bhishma, who comforted yudhi shthira, saying that what he had e he had e in observance of kshatriya duties. yudhishthira humbly approached bhishma and touched his feet bhishma, kissing his head, asked him to take a seat and question him without anxiety . yudhishthira solicited bhishma to discourse on kingly duties which are regarded as the root of all other duties in the world. bhishma, bowing to dharma, krishna, and the brahmans, set forth the general duties of kings he quoted two shlokas of manu fire has sprung from water, the kshatriya from the brahman, and iron from stone these three can exert their force on every other thing but on their origins, it is extinguished and two shlokas of m. ri. ushanas and a shloka of brihaspati . continuation of bhishmas discourse, enjoining readiness for action on kings quoting

. yudhish thira consulted his counsellors, brothers, ritvijes, ministers, dhaumya, dvaipaayana, etc as to the raajasuya . they all encouraged him to perform it. all people lived happily under his sway and loved him bhima ruled over all men justly, arjuna protected the people from enemies, sahadeva administered justice impartially, nakula behaved towards everybody with humility. there was no extortion, disease, etc. yudhishthira sent a messenger to krishna in dvaaravati, and krishna came to indraprastha accompanied by indrasena, and was consulted by yudhishthira . krishna said that yudhishthira, in order to become samraaj, ought to slay the magadha king jaraasandha, and deliver the princes whom jaraasandha held shut up in a mountain hole in order to sacrifice them to mahaadeva . the now existing kshatriyas are descended from the remnants of those who were exterminated by raama. they represent themselves to be the descendants of aila and ikshvaaku of those there are families. the bhojas, descendants of yayaati, are great and scattered all over the earth but now jaraasandha, ruling the middle land, has overpowered them. his allies are shishupaala, who has become his senaapati the karusha king vakra, who fights by illusion hamsa and dimbhaka dantavakra, karusha, karabha, meghavaahana bhagadatta, the yavana king, the ruler of the west, who bears on his head the most wonderful gem on earth, the old friend of thy father, and who chastises muru and naraka he obeys jaraasandha, but in his heart he is tied by affection to thee the king of anga, vanga, pundra, and of the kiraatas, paundraka vaasudeva, who among the cedis is called purushottama, and always bears, from foolishness, the distinctive signs of krishna bhishmaka, king of the bhojas, the friend of indra, who governs a fourth part of the world, who by his learning has conquered the paandyas, krathas, and kaishikas, and whose brother aakriti is like to raama jaamadagnya, has placed himself under jaraasandha, though krishna, etc his relatives, are engaged every day in ng what is agreeable to him. only yudhishthiras maternal uncle, the kunti king purujit, who has his inions in the west and the south, regards yudhishthira with affection. the following peoples have fled for fear of jaraasandha the eighteen tribes of the northern bhojas have fled towards the west the shurasenas, bhadrakaaras, bodhas, shaalvas, pataccaras, susthalas, mukuttas, kulindas, and kuntis the shaalvaayana kings with their brethren and followers, the southern paancaalas, and the eastern koshalas, have all fled to the kuntis the matsyas and the sannyastapaadas have left their inions in the north and fled into the southern country all the paancaalas have fled in all directions. jaraasandhas relations to the yaadavas were the following kamsa, having persecuted the yaadavas, married asti and praapti, daughters of jaraasandha and sisters of sahadeva, and began also to oppress the old chiefs of the bhojas, who sought the help of krishna, etc. krishna bestowed upon akrura the daughter of aahuka, and with sankarshana he slew kamsa and sunaaman. then jaraasandha took up arms, and the eighteen tribes thought they would be unable to check him even in years. his friends hamsa and dimbhaka were incapable of being slain by weapons. some other king, named hamsa, was slain by raama in the battle of the eighteen tribes then dimbhaka, thinking that he could not live without hamsa, killed himself in the yamunaa, and hamsa, hearing that, also jumped into the yamunaa then jaraasandha returned to his king, and the yaadavas continued to live at mathuraa. but the wi of kamsa, the daughter of jaraasandha, urging him to revenge the death of her husband, the yaadavas fled from mathuraa, and took up their abode in kushasthali, aned by raivata, and strongly fortified the gomanta mountains, three yojanas in length. in the race of krishna there are, brothers . aahuka has sons. caarudeshna with his brother, cakradeva, saatyaki, krishna, rauhineya, and shaamba are seven heroes kritavarman, anaadhrishti, shamika, samitinjaya, kanka, shanku, and kunti are seven mahaarathas then there are also two sons of andhakabhoja and himself all these heroes, remembering the middle country, are now living among the vrishnis . yudhishthira had some scruples, which were opposed by bhima and krishna, who cited from the krita age five kings, who had become emperors yauvanaashvi by the remission of taxes, bhagiratha by protection, kaartavirya by asceticism, bharata by strength, and marutta by prosperity families of kings have been unable to oppose jaraasandha he has already brought eighty six kings to the house of pashupati when he has fourteen more he will offer them as sacrifices . some further objections of yudhishthira are refuted by arjuna . the origin of jaraasandha was the following the magadha king brihadratha, who had three akshauhinis of troops, married the two twin daughters of the king of kaashi, making an engagement never to show a preference for either. as he was childless he repaired to the rishi canda kaushika, the son of kaakshivat gautama, who was sitting under a mango tree. he gave a mango fruit to the king, who gave it to his queens. they then brought forth each one half of a child, which were thrown away, but, found and laid together by the raakshasi jaraa, became one living child . jaraa had been created by svayambhu for the destruction of the daanavas and named grihadevi, and always lived in the kings house and did him good, because there was on the walls a likeness of her endued with youth and in the midst of children, and she was daily worshipped with scents, etc. the king ordered a great festival to be held in magadha in honour of jaraa, and named the boy jaraasandha . some time after canda kaushika again came to magadha, and foretold the greatness of jaraasandha, that weapons should not hurt him, and that he should see rudra. after having installed jaraasandha, brihadratha with his two wives retired to the woods and, after practising ascetic penances, ascended to heaven. when king kamsa was slain by vaasudeva, jaraasandha, from girivraja, whirling a mace ninety nine times, hurled it towards mathuraa, where krishna was residing at that time the mace fell at gadaavasaana, near mathuraa, at a distance of ninety nine yojanas . he, with hamsa and dimbhaka, were more than a match for the three worlds therefore, from policy, the kukuras, andhakas, and vrishnis, chose not to fight with him .

raamopaakhyaanaparvan . as yudhishthira asked maarkandeya if he knew any one more unfortunate than he was, maarkandeya related the story of raama daasharathi king aja of ikshvaakus race had a son dasharatha, who had four virtuous sons raama, lakshmana and shatrughna, and bharata . sitaa, the daughter of the videha king janaka, was created by tvashtri himself to become the wife of raama. prajaapati had a mind born son pulastya, who with a cow begat a son vaishravana . leaving his father, vaishravana went to his grandfather, and angered at this, his father with half of his own self became born as vishravas for wreaking vengeance on vaishravana. but pitaamaha, pleased with vaishravana, gave him immortality and made him the sovereign of wealth, a lokapaala and friend of ishaana, and gave him a son nalakubara, and lankaa for his capital, guarded by hosts of raakshasas, and the vimaana pushpaka capable of going everywhere, and the kingship of the yakshas, etc. . the muni vishravas was greatly enraged against vaishravana. kubera, the king of the raakshasas, always sought to please his father, and, living in lankaa, sent three raakshasa women skilled in singing and dancing to wait upon him. pulastya granted them boons to pushpotkataa two sons kumbhakarna and dasha griva maalini bore one son, vibhishana raakaa became the mother of the twins khara and shurpanakhaa. vibhishana surpassed everybody in beauty and was very pious dashagriva was energetic and strong kumbhakarna was the most powerful in battle and a master of illusion khara was proficient in archery and hostile to brahmans shurpanakhaa troubled the ascetics . learned in the vedas, they lived with their father on gandhamaadana. and there they beheld vaishravana seated with their father, and seized with jealousy, they gratified brahmaan with severe penances, while khara and shurpanakhaa protected and attended on them. after, years dashagriva, cutting off his head, offered it in the fire, and brahmaan appeared and made them desist from their austerities, granting them boons except immortality. now dashagriva defeated kubera in battle and drove him from lankaa kubera then, followed by gandharvas, yakshas, raakshasas, and kinnaras, went to live on gandhamaadana. raavana took from him pushpaka, upon which vaishravana cursed him saying this chariot shall never carry thee, but him who will slay thee in battle, and as thou hast insulted thy elder brother thou shalt soon die. vibhishana followed kubera, who invested him with the command of the yaksha and raakshasa hosts. on the other hand, the man eating raakshasas and pishaacas anointed dashagriva as their sovereign. dashagriva deprived the gods and daityas of their valuable possessions, and because he terrified all creatures, he was called raavana . the brahmarshis, siddhas, and devarshis, with agni as their spokesman, sought the protection of brahmaan, who said that the four armed vishnu had already been incarnate for this object, and caused indra and the gods, gandharvas, and daanavas to beget strong sons, capable of assuming any form at will, on monkeys and bears and the gandharvi dundubhi he caused to be born on earth as the hunch backed mantharaa, who, instructed by brahmaan, went hither and thither ever engaged in fomenting quarrels . asked by yudhishthira, maarkandeya related the sons of dasharatha were conversant with the vedas and the dhanurveda. raama equalled indra and brihaspati. at night, the pushya being in a lucky conjuncture, raama was to be invested as yuvaraaja. mantharaa aroused the jealousy of kaikeyi against kausalyaa, kaikeyi prevailed upon dasharatha that bharata should be anointed and raama be in exile in the forest of dandaka for fourteen years. raama was accompanied by lakshmana and sitaa. dasharatha died. bharata rebuked kaikeyi and set off to find raama, accompanied by kausalyaa, sumitraa, kaikeyi, shatrughna, vasishtha, vaamadeva, etc. he saw raama and lakshmana on the mountain citrakuta, but raama would adhere to the order of his father. bharata then ruled in nandi graama, keeping before him the shoes of raama. raavanagamana . sitaaharana .

kishkindhyaa. vaalin came out taaraa told him that it was raama, lakshmana, mainda, dvivida, hanumat, jaambavat, and sugriva who had come to destroy him. vaalin suspected taaraa. near the mountain maalyavat he had an encounter with sugriva. hanumat placed a garland round sugrivas neck, and raama recognized sugriva by that sign and killed vaalin with an arrow. sugriva thus regained kishkindhyaa

b . vyaasa said in the krita age manu was the ruler prasandhi kshupa ikshvaaku vimsha vivimsha khaninetra suvarcas karandhama avikshit kaarandhama marutta . desirous of performing a sacrifice, marutta, coming to meru, on the northern side of himavat, caused thousands of gold vessels to be forged there on a huge golden hill he performed the rites along with other princes . asked by yudhishthira, vyaasa said as the offspring of prajaapati daksha, . and as challenged each other, so did angiras sons brihaspati and samvarta troubled by his elder brother samvarta went naked to the woods. indra, having vanquished the as appointed brih. as his priest. formerly angiras was the family priest of king karandhama so also of his son avikshit . his son marutta used to defy indra, and indra used to defy marutta, but could not prevail over him. then indra took the promise from brih. that he would not perform priestly offices for marutta . vaishampaayana said then indra was cured for his envy and went home . vyaasa said the ancient tale of the discourse between brih. and marutta is cited in this connection. marutta in vain tried to persuade brih. to officiate at his sacrifice . ri. naarada told him to apply to samvarta, who now, desirous of seeing maheshvara, wandered about in vaaraanasi in the garb of a madman having reached the gate of that city, thou must place a dead body somewhere near it, and the man who shall turn away on seeing the corpse, thou know that man to be samvarta if he should ask thee to follow me, said naarada, thou mayst even tell him without hesitation that have ascended the pyre. vyaasa said by acting thus, marutta found samvarta in a lonely place samvarta covered him with mud and ashes and phlegm and spittle. at last he sat n under a nyagrodha tree . marutta told him the matter samvarta then, as a lunatic, scolding marutta repeatedly with harsh words, told him to go to brih. first, and taking brih.s permission he might come back. as marutta said that he had already been repulsed by brih and that he now desired to sacrifice even with all his goods in order to outstrip indra, samvarta consented, if marutta would agree to all that samvarta would ask him to as brih. and indra were certain to all they could to injure marutta. marutta took an oath to this. samvarta said that marutta would surpass indra, and g. he himself had no desire for wealth, but would only what was disagreeable to indra and brih. . samvarta said there is a peak munjavat on the himaalaya, where shiva is constantly engaged in austerities go thither and appease shiva, whose names are sharva, etc. then thou shalt acquire that gold. marutta acted accordingly brih. became sick from envy indra with . came and was told about the matter . he despatched agni to marutta, asking him to let brih. officiate as his priest instead of samvarta, promising him the greatest rewards samvarta threatened to burn agni with his fearful eye, if he ever came again on such an errand. agni was frightened and returned to indra and brih. and said that marutta had refused and did not care for his promises. indra asked agni to return to marutta, and threatened him with indras thunderbolt if he did not obey agni, afraid of samvarta, suggested that the g. king should go indra said that nobody could burn agni agni asked why then vritra could deprive indra of the sovereignty of heaven indra, mentioning his victories over the kaalakeyas, daa and prahlaada, said that it was because he did not accept soma from a foe, nor strike the weak with his thunderbolt agni reminded him of cyavana at sharyaatis sacrifice and the creation of mada the might of brahmans is greater than that of kshatriyas . then indra sent g. dhritaraashtra on the same errand, but in vain. vyaasa said as the clouds indicated that indra must be near, marutta repaired to samvarta, who comforted him, saying that agni would protect him, and that he would himself dispel the thunder by the winds, and granted him the boon that indra should come in person to his sacrifice and accept the oblations offered to him, and so should all the gods. and so it happened by the power of samvartas incantations. re quested by samvarta, indra himself gave directions to all the gods to erect a hall of assembly, well furnished rooms with a durable staircase for the ascent of g. and aps and to furnish that portion of the sacrificial ground reserved for the dance of aps like unto the palace of indra in heaven indra said that maruttas ancestors and the gods had been highly pleased, and told him to offer a red bull to agni, and a blue bull with a variegated skin to . . then indra and the gods returned home. marutta placed heaps of gold on various spots and distributed immense wealth to the brahmans.

. drupadas purohita was honoured by dhritaraashtra, bhishma, and vidura. he mentioned the eternal duties of kings the paandavas had not obtained their share of the paternal wealth the murderous contrivances of the dhaartaraashtras the deceitful game the indignities in the council hall the exile for thirteen years the paandavas desired nothing but a peaceful settlement the paandavas were more powerful men like saatyaki, bhimasena, and the twins were equal in might to, akshauhinis arjuna and krishna nobody could fight . bhishma approved of his speech but karna wrathfully interrupted him. dhritaraashtra pacified bhishma, rebuked karna, sent drupadas purohita back to the paandavas, and summoned sanjaya to the council hall . dhritaraashtra gave instructions to sanjaya, praising the paandavas and krishna and some of their adherents, mentioning the killing of shishupaala, blaming duryodhana, and karna, and ordered him to go to upaplavya to salute them and the five sons of draupadi, and tell them that dhritaraashtra was desirous of peace with the paandavas . sanjaya came to upaplavya and saluted yudhishthira and enquired about bhimasena, etc. . yudhishthira inquired about dhrita raashtra, etc and mentioned the prowess of arjuna, sahadeva, nakula, and the ghoshayaatraa . sanjaya delivered his message and answered yudhishthiras questions . in the presence of the paandavas, etc sanjaya greeted yudhishthira, etc and recommended peace, for what, in sooth, is life after having killed all your kinsfolk he mentioned krishna, etc. on the side of the paandavas, and drona, etc on the side of the kauravas . yudhishthira said that peace was preferable to war, but complained that duryodhana had disregarded the words of vidura, and dhritaraashtra had been desirous solely of satisfying his sons that duryodhanas counsellors were now dushaasana, shakuni, and karna. he compared arjuna, bhima, nakula, and sahadeva with karna and duryodhana. he claimed indraprastha for his king . sanjaya declared that if, without war, the kurus would not yield his share to yudhishthira, then it would be far better for him to live upon alms in the king of the andhakas and the vrishnis than to obtain sovereignty by war . yudhishthira said that virtue and vice, which are both eternal and absolute, exchange their aspects during seasons of distress he would not seek even what belongs to prajaapati, or heaven, or brahmaloka by unrighteous means but he would be guided by krishna, as did saatyaki, etc. krishna was the great judge of the propriety or otherwise of all acts . krishna said he wished prosperity for both the paandavas and dhritaraashtra therefore he desired peace but when dhritaraashtra and his sons were so covetous, war was inevitable some say that work should be shunned and that salvation is attainable by knowledge but the brahmans know this, that though one may have a knowledge of eatable things, yet the hunger will not be appeased unless one actually eats such branches of knowledge as are of use in ng works bear fruit, but not the other ones. in the other world it is by virtue of work that the gods, etc. flourish. yudhishthira is constantly engaged in the study of the veda he is bent on the horse sacrifice and the raajasuya he rides horses and elephants, etc. if the paandavas could see a course of action not involving the slaughter of the sons of kuru, they would at it. but we must take into con sideration the division into four castes and the respective duties allotted to each . war and weapons were invented by indra for putting the dasyus to death. krishna alluded to the game and the role of shakuni there, to the indignities undergone by krishnaa from dushaasana and karna, while the kurus with bhishma at their head did not interfere, and only vidura took her part and that dushaasana had called the paandaras eunuchs at their departure. he would go in person to the kurus. he compared the evil passions of duryodhana, etc with the righteousness of yudhishthira, etc. . king dhritaraashtra with his sons constitute a forest, while the paandavas are its tigers not cut n the forest with its tigers, and let not the tigers be driven away from the forest the tiger out of the wood is easily slain the wood also that is without a tiger is easily cut n. similarly the dhaartaraashtras are as creepers, the paandavas are shaala trees, and the creepers cannot dis pense with a large tree round which it can twine . sanjaya then bade farewell to yudhishthira, etc. . yudhishthira spoke approvingly of sanjayas agreeable speech and excellent conduct as an ambassa, and com pared him to vidura, and declared him to be as dear to them as dhananjaya . he recommended the brahmans to him, and told him to salute drona, etc and the aged, middle aged, and young ladies, the daughters of our house, and the maidservants and manservants, and the many humpbacked and lame ones among them, and those that were defective in limb, or imbecile, and the dwarfs to whom dhritaraashtra gave food and raiment from motives of humanity, the blind, the aged, the many that had the use only of their hands, being destitute of legs, the masterless and weak, those that vainly strived to earn a living, the ignorant, in fact, all those that were in pitiable circum stances, all the ambassas arrived from all sides, etc. he concluded with this message to duryodhana give me back my own indraprastha, or fight with me . yudhishthira said that the creator gives and takes according to his will. he told sanjaya especially to salute dhritaraashtra, bhishma, and vidura, and recommend the paandavas to them, that they might counsel peace and to say to duryodhana that the paandavas were willing to forgive his insults to draupadi and dushaasanas dragging her, disregarding kunti but they must have their proper share of the king give us even a single province of the empire give us even kushasthala, vrikasthala, maakandi, vaaranaavata, and in the fifth place any other village that thou likest even this will end the quarrel. he said that to see the kurus and the paanshaalas live happily united was what he desired . having returned to haastinapura, sanjaya addressed dhritaraashtra at night he praised yudhishthira, who shines in his natural perfection, leaving his load of sins to be borne by thee, while dhritaraashtras acts were contrary to both religion and profit. in delivering the message from yudhishthira he did not mention the alternative of giving them the five villages. he alluded to arjunas ascending to the very heavens and being honoured there. king bali, not finding a primary cause, regarded time to be the cause of everything. to morrow morning the kurus, assembled together in the council hall, will hear the words of ajaatashatru .

. . krishna related when shishupaala, the son of damaghosha, had been slain, his brother, the maarttikaa vata king shaalva, in order to avenge him, came to dvaarakaa in the saubha, who moved at will and slew many of the vrishnis, and sought for krishna desiring to kill him. krishna was in indraprastha at the raajasuya of yudhishthira, and when he learnt this on returning home, he set out to slay him, and found him in an island in the ocean, and blowing his conch paancajanya, slew numerous daanavas. then, as soon as he heard of the game at dice, he had come to the paandavas . . copious description of the combats with shaalva when shaalva attacked dvaarakaa it was well furnished and strongly fortified and defended by gada, shaamba, etc. . caarudeshna, shaamba, and pradyumna rushed out against him. they on both sides fought by means of maayaa. shaamba put kshemarriddhi, the commander of shaalvas troops, to flight by a shower of arrows, and slew a daiteya named vegavat with his mace. caarudeshna slew the daanava vivindhya with a consecrated arrow. then shaalva, riding on saubha, encountered pradyumna . riding on his chariot with a gaping makara in its standard, pradyumna with showers of arrows slew the daanavas and pierced the heart of shaalva so that he fell in a swoon, but he rose again and wounded pradyumna about his throat so that he became senseless . pradyumnas charioteer daaruki, a suta, carried him off the field by the help of his fleet steeds, but when pradyumna had regained his senses, he ordered him to turn the chariot, reminding him of the customs of the vrishnis in battle, and saying that he had restrained kritavarman, the son of hridika, from sallying out, as he would himself resist shaalva . as shaalva used his maayaa of the asuras, pradyumna shot him n with the brahmaastra, and was about to aim another arrow at him, capable of killing any person, when all the hosts of the gods, with indra and dhaneshvara, sent naarada and shvasana, who ordered him to desist as the creator had destined krishna, the son of devaki, to slay him. shaalva then mounted saubha and went away through the skies leaving dvaarakaa . when shaalva had left dvaarakaa, krishna returned from the raajasuya, and found dvaarakaa deprived of its splenr, etc. he learnt from haardikya about the invasion of shaalva, committed the city to the charge of king aahuka and aanakadundubhi, etc bowed to bhava, and set out on his chariot yoked with shaibya and sugriva and with daaruka for his charioteer, blowing the paancajanya, till he arrived at maarttikaavata, and pursued shaalva, who, staying in saubha, remained in the sky above the midst of the ocean a krosha off, so that krishnas soldiers could not see it, but were obliged to stand as mere spectators. after a long battle with arrows, in which krishna killed numerous daanavas, they took to fight by means of illusion, whirling maces, ploughshares, etc and then mountain peaks. as none could ascertain whether it was day or night, or distinguish the points of the horizon, krishna, becoming bewildered, made use of the prajnaastra, by which he regained light . daaruka was covered all over with shafts. then a messenger of aahuka came from dvaarakaa, saying that shaalva had come to dvaarakaa and had slain vasudeva. krishna thought that then saatyaki, baladeva, pradyumna, caarudeshna, shaamba, etc must necessarily have been killed first. now he saw vasudeva falling from saubha, and swooned away but, as he, after regaining consciousness, saw neither saubha, nor shaalva, nor vasudeva, he concluded that it was illusion . though krishna could not see saubha, which had vanished through illusion, he discharged many arrows from the shaarnga. the daanavas set up a loud howl, and when krishna, making use of a weapon that pierced the foe following the sound, killed them at one place, the yell ceased at that place and started from another quarter. then saubha reappeared at praagjyotisha. krishna, daaruka, and the horses were covered by torrents of rocks that concealed them, and the vrishnis fled in all directions. krishna then destroyed the crags with indras thunderbolt, daaruka pointed at shaalva and exhorted krishna to slay him. krishna made use of his aagneya weapon and hurled his discus sudarshana against the city of saubha, that fell cut in twain like the city of tripura by the shafts of maheshvara. then the discus came back into his hands and was hurled against shaalva and cut him in twain. the remaining daanavas fled in fear. krishna returned to the aanarttas. it was for this reason that he could not come to haastinapura and prevent the gambling. then krishna took leave of yudhishthira, etc and set out for dvaarakaa in his chariot yoked with shaibya and sugriva, taking with him subhadraa and abhimanyu. then dhrishtadyumna set out for his own city, taking with him the draupadeyas. and the cedi king, dhrishtaketu, set out for his beautiful city of shuktimati, taking with him his sister . also the kaikeyas went away. but the brahmans, vaishyas, and inhabitants of the country would not leave the paandavas. yudhishthira in due time ordered his men to make the chariots ready .

a leader for the celestial host, repaired to the maanasa mountain, and, hearing a woman crying for protection, rescued her from the asura keshin, whom he wounded and put to flight . she told indra that she was devasenaa, daughter of prajaapati, and that her sister daityasenaa had let herself be taken away by keshin from the maanasa mountain, where they used to sport with their female friends with the permission of prajaapati. indra said that she was a sisters daughter of his mother daakshaayani. she asked indra to select a husband for her, who was able to conquer the gods, daanavas, yakshas, kinnaras, uragas, rakshas, and daityas. indra was grieved, thinking there was no such husband for her. . then indra perceived the sun rising from the udaya hill, and soma entering the sun on the amaavasyaa at the raudra muhurta, and the gods and asuras fighting on the udaya mountain, the morning twilight tinged with red clouds, the sea blood red bhrigus and angirases offered oblations, and agni took the oblations and entered the sun, whilst the sun was entering the twenty fourth parvan, and sindhu was flowing with a current of fresh blood, etc. indra thought that, if now soma or agni gave birth to a son, this son might become the husband of devasenaa. then he repaired with devasenaa to the world of brahmaan, who promised that it should be as indra had thought. then indra. with devasenaa, repaired to the place where the devarshis vasishtha, etc. lived, and the gods also came thither to drink soma and receive their shares of offerings, and the adbhuta fire came from the solar disc to the aahavaniya and made over the offerings to the gods. he, then saw the wives of the rishis sleeping in their aashramas and fell in love. in order to look at them daily, he entered the gaarhapatya fire, and dwelt there for a long time, and at last, from despair, repaired to a forest in order to away with himself. svaahaa, daughter of daksha, who had in vain loved adbhuta, now resolved upon assuming the guise of the wives of the seven rishis . svaahaa first gratified her desire in the guise of shivaa, the wife of angiras, and then, lest somebody should unduly suspect the braahmana ladies, she went out of the forest in the guise of a bird, and on the shveta mountain, that was covered with clumps of reeds and guarded with seven headed poisonous serpents, raakshasas, pishaacas, etc she threw the semen, which she held in her hand, into a golden basin. then, assuming successively the form of five of the others, she did the same on the first lunar day . only the form of arundhati she was unable to assume because of her ascetic merit and devotion to her husband. the semen produced a child, whom the rishis called skanda, with six heads, etc. on the second day it first assumed a form, on the rd it looked like a little child, on the fourth the limbs were developed. seizing the bow used by the destroyer of tripura, skanda uttered a terrible roar, so that the great naagas citra and airaavata sprang up. but skanda seized them with two of his hands, and holding a dart in one hand, a cock in another, etc and blowing a conch shell, he terrified the creatures with his roars. the persons of various orders, who then sought the protection of skanda, are called his followers by the brahmans . discharging his arrows in the direction of the shveta mountain, he rent asunder the mountain kraunca, the son of himavat therefore the swans and vultures go to the mountain meru. the other mountains also screamed aloud. then, with his lance, he rent in twain one of the peaks of the shveta mountain. mount shveta and the other mountains left the earth and fled the earth was torn asunder on all sides she went to skanda and regained her power the mountains bowed n to skanda and came back to the earth, and all creatures worshipped skanda on the fifth day of the lunar month . . terrific prodigies were seen everywhere. the rishis tried to restore tranquillity to the universe. the inhabitants of the caitra ratha forest accused the wives of the six rishis, other ones the fowl of being the cause thereof but nobody suspected svaahaa. the seven rishis divorced their wives with the exception of arundhati, though svaahaa claimed the child as hers. vishvaamitra, having concluded the sacrifice of the seven rishis, had secretly followed the god of fire, and knew everything as it had happened. he sought the protection of skanda, and performed for him the thirteen auspicious rites of childhood the jaalakarman, etc etc. though vishvaamitra informed the seven rishis of the innocence of their wives, yet they abaned them unconditionally. . the gods asked indra to kill skanda, but he dared not attack him, saying that skanda was able to destroy even the creator of the world. then they let the mothers of the world approach in order to kill skanda, but they ated him as their son and let him suck their breasts, especially the daughter of krodha with a spike in her hand, and the daughter of the red sea, who lived on blood and his father agni came and, transformed into naigameya with a goats month, gratified him with toys .

. . naarada related in days of yore the daitya nikumbha of the race of hiranyakashipu had two sons, sunda and upasunda, who always shared with each other happiness as well as woe, and never went anywhere unless together. desirous of subjugating the three worlds, they practised terrible penances on the mountain vindhya, which, by the power of their austerities at last began to emit vapour. in vain the gods repeatedly tempted them by means of every precious possession and beautiful girls, and by illusion, causing their sisters, mothers, wives, etc to appear pursued by a raakshasa and imploring their help. when brahmaan granted them a boon, they asked to become immortal, which he refused, granting them instead that they should not need to be afraid of anything except each other, etc. they now desisted from their asceticism and returned to their abode, where they lived happy, causing even the moon to rise over their city every night, even out of season . they set out to conquer the three worlds in the night under the constellation of maghaa, with a large daitya force cased in mail, etc. the gods sought refuge in brahmaloka, and the daityas subjugated indraloka, and van quished the tribes of the yakshas and rakshases, and the khecaras, and the naagas in the earth, and the tribes of the mlecchas dwelling in the ocean. in order to extinguish the sacrifices that strengthened the gods, they slew those that were performing sacrifices and the assistant brahmans, etc. then they took up their abode in kurukshetra . the devarshis and siddhas and rishis were affected with great grief, and went to the abode of pitaamaha, seated with the gods, the siddhas, and the brahmarshis, mahaadeva, agni, vaayu, the sun and moon, shakra, the paarameshthya rishis, the vaikhaanasas, the vaalakhilyas, the vaanaprasthas, the maricipas, the ajas, the avimudhas, etc. brahmaan sent tilottamaa to them . she came to sunda and upasunda as they were sporting in the vindhya mountains, and from jealousy they struck each other to death with their maces. and pitaamaha then came there with the gods and the great rishis, and granted to tilottamaa that she should roam in the region of the aadityas. then, bestowing the three worlds on indra as before, he returned to his own region.

. b . vasishtha told to raama jaamadagnya after the wedding of rudra and devi on himavat, all the gods, fearing that rudras offspring would consume the worlds, prevailed upon him to withdraw his vital seed umaa cursed the gods, saying that they should become sonless but agni was not present. a small quantity of rudras seed, however, leaped into fire and began to develop mean while, the gods, with indra, were scorched by as. taaraka aa r m a and saa. all became afflicted all the regions of the deities, etc and the retreats of ri. were snatched away by as. . and ri. repaired to brahmaan, who had granted taaraka the boon that he should not be killed by as or raa and umaa had cursed . brahmaan said that agni was not there therefore his offspring, transcending daa raa even g n and birds, will with his dart destroy taaraka kaama is eternal, and in order to slay the enemies of the gods agni will throw rudras seed into the gangaa. the gods failed to find out agni a frog, having been scorched by the energy of agni, appeared on the surface of the water, and said to the gods that agni was now under the water agni, leaving the spot, cursed the frogs, saying that they should be without taste the gods granted them boons . an elephant revealed to the gods that agni was now residing within a certain ashvattha tree agni, entering the heart of the shami tree, cursed all the elephants, saying that their tongues should be bent back the gods granted that they should be able to eat everything and utter indistinct cries. agni was then revealed by a parrot, and cursed the parrots, saying that they should be deprived of the power of speech the gods granted them to speak the letter k, and made shami wood a sacred resting place of fire. the waters in the nethermost regions had come into contact with agni, and those heated waters are vomited forth by the mountain springs. the gods asked agni to rescue prajaapatis, and ri. from taaraka by begetting a heroic son. agni united himself spiritually with gangaa an asura uttered a frightful roar gangaa became agitated and unable to bear the seed, and threw it off on meru the fœtus had the complexion of gold, etc. therefore ri. and . called agni by the name of hiranyaretas, and the earth vasumati . that fœtus, having fallen in a thicket of reeds, assumed a wonderful form the krittikaa reared it as their son, whence it came to be called kaarttikeya he was also called skanda and guha . it was in this way that gold came into existence as the offspring of agni, and hence gold was called jaatarupa gold is truly the illustrious agni, the lord of all things, and the foremost of all prajaapatis the most sacred of all sacred things is gold it has for its essence agni and soma. vasishtha continued this tale was also heard by me in days of yore about brahmaan paramaatman in days of yore, rudra, who is brahmaan, etc having assumed the form of varuna, performed a sacrifice, to which came the munis and all the deities with agni, etc. . shiva then himself poured libations into his own self. at the sight of the celestial damsels the seed of brahmaan fell upon the earth pushan took it up, and it was taken with the sacrificial ladle and poured as an oblation into the fire thence brahmaan caused the orders of beings to spring into existence further bhrigu, etc. for this reason agni is said to be all the deities. bhrigu was reckoned the offspring of varuna, angiras that of agni, kavi that of brahmaan bhrigu, angiras, and kavi were all of them prajaanaam pataya their offspring are called vaarunaa, and kavi and bhrigu vaarunau. agni is brahmaan, pashupati, etc. gold is the offspring of agni when fire is not obtainable gold is used as a substitute, oh jaamadagnya by one who is conversant with the vedic authorities, etc. agni sprang from brahmaan, and from agni sprang gold those persons observant of righteousness who make gifts of gold are regarded as giving away all the deities, etc. he who makes a gift of gold at the second twilight succeeds in attaining to residence with brahmaan, vaayu, agni, and soma, and to the regions of indra, etc. he has never to fall n from the regions to which he attains . after a long time kaarttikeya grew up, and was chosen as generalissimo by all the gods with indra he slew dai. taaraka and many other asuras. bhishma continued thus addressed by vasishtha jaama dagnya made gifts of gold to the brahmans and became cleansed of his sins .

. . . the paandavas went to the paancaala land in the company of brahmans, who told them of the svayamvara, and of dhrishta dyumna, and krishnaa . on their way they beheld dvaipaayana. they took up their quarters in the house of a potter, and ating the brahmanical profession, they began to lead a mendicant life. yajnasena always cherished the wish of bestowing his daughter on kiritin, but never spoke of this wish to anybody. he therefore caused a very stiff bow to be made, which was incapable of being bent by anybody except arjuna and causing some machinery to be erected in the sky, he set up a mark attached to that machinery, and said he who with this bow and these arrows hits the mark shall obtain my daughter. among the kings that came were duryodhana and the kurus and karna. the princes entered the arena by the north eastern gate . the arena was situated to the north east of the capital . on the day draupadi, having bathed, entered the arena. then the purohita of the somakas gratified agni. dhrishtadyumna, possessing a voice deep as that of a kettle drum or of the clouds, taking hold of his sisters arm, stood in the midst of the arena, and said hit the mark by means of these five arrows. then he addressed his sister, reciting to her the names, etc. of the assembled princes . . enumeration of the assembled princes . . there came also the devaganas on their chariots the rudras and the aadityas, the vasus and the ashvins, the saadhyas and all the maruts, with yama and dhaneshvara walking ahead and also the daityas and suparnas, the mahoragas, the devarshis, the guhyakas and the caaranas, vishvaavasu, naarada and parvata, the principal gandharvas with the apsarases, and the asuras and siddhas, and halaayudha, and janaardana, and the chiefs of the vrishnis, andhakas, and yadus, always obedient to krishna. krishna pointed out the paandavas to his brother raama. when duryodhana, the cedi king shishupaala, jaraasandha, the madra king shalya, etc. had in vain tried to string the bow, and karna, though having succeeded in stringing it, had, as a suta, been rejected by krishnaa, jishnu came forward . some of the brahmans spoke reproachingly of arjunas daring undertaking, some approved of it . arjuna, bending his head to ishaana and remembering krishna, accom plished the task. the gods showered celestial flowers. drupada was filled with joy. yudhishthira with the twins returned home. krishnaa approached arjuna, who soon after wards left the lists followed by her . . when drupada expressed his desire of bestowing his daughter on that brahman, the kings resolved to slay drupada and burn krishnaa, but spare arjuna, whom they took for a brahman. they rushed at drupada, who was defended by arjuna with the bow and by bhima with a tree torn up by the root. krishna then knew, and said to balaraama that they must be the paandavas, who had escaped from the fire . karna was defeated by arjuna, and the madra king shalya by bhima then duryodhana, etc who had been engaged with the brahmans, desisted from the combat, because brahmans, though offending, should yet always be protected. krishna said to them that those brahmans had justly acquired the maiden. the kings returned to their respective kings. bhima and arjuna, with difficulty, escaped from the throng, followed by krishnaa. . kunti was filled with anxiety, seeing that her sons were late in returning from their begging tour. then, in the late afternoon, jishnu, accompanied by a body of brahmans, entered the abode of the bhaargava . bhima and arjuna presented krishnaa as their alms, and kunti, not yet seeing them, said enjoy ye all. afterwards, she was alarmed at what she had said. yudhishthira declared that arjuna should wed her but arjuna replied that it was a sin for the younger brother to marry before the elder. meanwhile, they all fell in love with krishnaa. then yudhishthira recollected the words of vyaasa, and, from fear of a division amongst the brothers, said that she should be the common wife of them all. krishna and balaraama then paid them a visit, and again went away . when bhima and arjuna were turning towards the abode of the bhaargava, dhrishta dyumna followed them and concealed himself in some part of the house. then bhima and arjuna and the twins returning from their begging tour in the evening, gave everything to yudhishthira. kunti caused krishnaa to distribute it, giving to bhima alone as much as to all the others, because he always ate much. then they laid n for the night, and dhrishta dyumna overheard their conversations. in the morning dhrishtadyumna set out to report it to drupada, who was sad, because he did not know, if perhaps a man of mean descent had taken away his daughter, though he thought it possible that it was arjuna .

. . arjuna asked why he had called him taapatya, and citraratha said surya had a lovely daughter tapati, the younger sister of saavitri. rikshas son, the king samvarana, duly worshipped surya to him surya resolved to bestow his daughter. once, when samvarana went on a hunting expedition, his steed died from fatigue on the mountain, and he began to wander on foot and saw tapati alone, and declared her his love. she did not speak a word, but disappeared. he wandered through the whole forest in search of her, and failing to find her, indulged in lamentations . he fell n on the earth. then she appeared again. he asked her to marry him according to the gaandharva form of marriage. she said that she loved him, but told him to ask her father aaditya for her hand, with worship, ascetic penances, and vows . tapati then ascended to the skies, and samvarana again fell n on the earth. at last his followers found him, and his minister raised him up and sprinkled his head with water, etc. regaining his consciousness, samvarana sent away all his attendants with the exception of his minister alone, and then began to worship surya. he also thought of his purohita, the rishi vasishtha. after the king had stayed thus on the same spot day and night, the viprarshi vasishtha came there on the day. vasishtha knew at once, by his ascetic power, what had happened and ascended to the sky in order to see surya, and asked him to give tapati to samvarana. samvarana, with due rites, took tapatis hand on that mountain resorted to by the gods and the gandharvas. and the king caused vasishtha to be proclaimed his regent in his capital and king, etc and sported with his wife in the woods on that mountain for twelve years. now indra for twelve years poured no rain in his capital and king. then vasishtha brought samvarana and his wife back into the city, and then indra poured rain in abundance. samvarana, with tapati, performed sacrifices for twelve years. their son was kuru, the ancestor of arjuna .

. draupadi, bhimasena, nakula, and sahadeva lamented arjuna sahadeva suggested to move from the kaamyaka wood . then came the devarshi naarada who, at the request of yudhishthira, told them what the brahmarshi pulastya had formerly said to bhishma about the merits of circumambulating the earth for the purpose of visiting the tirthas, when bhishma was engaged in a pitrya vrata at gangaadvaara in the company of munis, and made oblations to the pitris, gods, and rishis . at bhishmas request pulastya explained the qualities of a person who will acquire merit by visiting tirthas he said that the costly sacrifices, which only kings and very rich men are capable of affording, are not of greater merit than a sojourn in tirthas, which even the poorest may accom plish. then he first described pushkara . then he enumerated a great many of tirthas and the merit of visiting them. vadavaa . pulastyas enumeration of tirthas continued . kurukshetra . the enumeration con tinued. raamahradaa . the

enumeration continued. gangaa is equal to kurukshetra, wherever one may bathe in it, especially in kanakhala and in prayaaga, which is the most excellent a bath in the gangaa in that place removes sins. in the kritayuga all the tirthas were sacred, in the tretaayuga pushkara alone, in the dvaapara kurukshetra, in the kaliyuga gangaa. in pushkara one should practise austerities, in mahaalaya one should make gifts, on the malaya one should ascend the funeral pyre, in bhrigutunga one should kill oneself by fasting bathing in pushkara, kurukshetra, the gangaa, and magadha one purifies seven generations of ones race upwards and nwards, etc. as long as ones bones lie in contact with the water of the gangaa, so long s one live, honoured in heaven . pitaamaha has said that no tirtha is equal to the gangaa, no god to keshava, and none is superior to brahmans. this truthful description one should recite only to the twice born, etc. . in these tirthas have bathed the vasus, the saadhyas, the aadityas, the maruts, the ashvins, and the rishis, who are equal to the gods. only men of piety and learning are able to visit these tirthas on account of their purified senses, their belief in god, and their acquaintance with the vedas . naarada continued then pulastya disappeared, and bhishma, at the command of pulastya, wandered over the earth and ended his tirthayaatraa at prayaaga. the man that so walks about the earth is rewarded after death as much as for horse sacrifices. so wilt thou yudhishthira obtain the eight fold dharma, as bhishma did before, and because thou wilt lead the rishis, thy merit will be eight fold those tirthas are infested by raakshasas, and no king, save thyself, has gone there . the foremost of rishis are always there and expect thee vaalmiki, kashyapa, aatreya, kundajathara, vishvaamitra, gautama, asita devala, maarkandeya, gaalava, bharadvaaja, vasishtha, uddaalaka, shaunaka with his son, vyaasa, durvaasas, and jaabaali. with them thou visit these tirthas. the great rishi lomasha will come to thee, thou follow him and me to these tirthas. then naarada disappeared and yudhishthira spoke to the ascetics of the tirthas . dhaumya tirthaka thana . while dhaumya was speaking thus, lomasha arrived and told that arjuna had obtained brahma shiras, learnt the gaandharva veda, etc. . lomasha said that arjuna had asked him to cause yudhishthira to visit all tirthas, like manu and other raajarshis, and protect him from the raakshasas as dadhica had protected indra and angiras had protected the sun. lomasha had twice before visited the tirthas. at the command of lomasha, yudhishthira caused the citizens, brahmans, and yatis, who were not able to endure the privations of the journey, to return to haasti napura, where dhritaraashtra gave them their proper allow ances from affection for yudhishthira, and yudhishthira, with only a small number of brahmans abode for three nights at kaamyaka cheered by lomasha . the brahmans, who dwelt in the wood, prevailed upon yudhishthira that he allowed them to partake of the tirthayaatraa. just when they were about to start, vyaasa, parvata, and naarada came to kaamyaka, and caused them not only to fulfil human vows by purifying the body, but even divine vows by purifying the heart, that it might be free from evil thoughts and harbour only friendly feelings towards everybody. when those celestial and human rishis had performed the usual propitiatory ceremonies, and when they had worshipped the feet of lomasha, dvaipaayana, naarada, and the devarshi parvata, the paandavas and krishnaa started towards the east with dhaumya and the ascetics on the day following maargashirshi, when pushya was in ascendance, dressed in bark and hides, with matted locks, cased in mail, and armed with swords, etc with indrasena and other attendants with some fourteen chariots and a number of cooks . as yudhi shthira asked why he who is virtuous is unhappy, and his enemies who are sinful, happy, lomasha said that sinful men often prosper in consequence of their sins, but at last they are overtaken by destruction, even as in the devayuga the daiteyas and daanavas, who practised vice and did not visit the tirthas, for a time prospered by their sin and vanquished the gods, who practised virtue and visited the tirthas at last, when the good qualities, prosperity, etc left the asuras and went to the gods, while bad qualities, adversity, etc came to the asuras, and kali possessed them, they were overtaken by destruction. nriga, shibi aushinara, bhagiratha, vasumanas, gaya, puru, and pururavas had by practising ascetic penances and visiting tirthas, etc obtained fame and wealth, etc and so would yudhishthira, and as ikshvaaku with his sons, etc and mucukunda, maandhaatri, and marutta, and the gods and devarshis obtained fame by the power of asceticism, so would yudhishthira, while the dhaartaraashtras, enslaved by sinfulness and ignorance, soon would be exterminated . the paandavas with their followers, proceeding from place to place, at last arrived at naimisha, and thence to the gomati, etc. . brahmasaras . gaya . thence they came to the hermitage of agastya, and dwelt in durjayaa there asked by yudhishthira lomasha told agastyopaakhyaana . descrip tion of the gangaa . then, having at the suggestion of lomasha, with his brothers and krishnaa, bathed in bhrigos tirtham and gratified the gods and pitris, yudhishthira blazed forth in brighter effulgence and became invincible. at his request lomasha told jaamadagnyatejohaanikathana . yudhishthira wished to hear the details of agastya. lomasha related agastyopaakhyaana . at the request of yudhishthira lomasha related how agastya had caused vindhya to cease to increase, how agastya drank up the ocean, sagara, asamanjas, gangaavatarana . then yudhishthira pro ceeded to the rivers nandaa and aparanandaa and the hemakuta mountain. having, at the command of lomasha, bathed in nandaa, they proceeded to the river kaushiki with the hermitages of vishvaamitra and of kaashyapa, the father of rishyashringa . at the request of yudhi shthira lomasha told the history of rishyashringa starting from kaushiki, yudhishthira in succession repaired to all the sacred shrines and came to the sea where the gangaa falls into it, and bathed in the centre of rivers. then they proceeded by the shore of the sea towards the kalinga country. lomasha said here is the river vaitarani . when they had all bathed in the vaitarani, yudhishthira felt as if he were carried off from the region of men, and beheld all worlds, and heard the reciting of vaikhaanasas, whom lomasha declared to be at the distance of, yojanas. lomasha ordered him to be silent, as this was the divine forest of svayambhu taught by lomasha the words to be recited yudhishthira mounted the altar of kashyapa and bathed in the sea then he went to the mahendra mountain and spent the night there . lomasha told yudhishthira the names of the ascetics, and he, with his brothers, paid a visit to them. akritavrana, a follower of raama jaamadagnya, told him when parashu raama appeared, and that the following day was the th. at the request of yudhishthira, akritavrana related the story of arjuna kaartavirya, and jamadagni, and parashuraama mahendraacala gamana . on their journey to the tirthas they bathed in a holy stream, and thence reached to godaavari and to the sea then to agastyatirtha and the naari tirthas, where they heard of and praised the deed of arjuna, and gave away thousands of cows, and by and by they reached shurpaaraka, where they saw the altar of ricikas son surrounded by crowds of ascetics, and the shrines of the vasus, of the hosts of the maruts, of the ashvins, vaivasvata, aaditya, dhaneshvara, indra, vishnu, savitri, bhava, candra, divaakara, and of the lord of waters, and of the host of saadhyas, of dhaatri, of the pitris, of rudra with his host, of sarasvati, of the host of siddhas, etc and then returned to shurpaaraka, and from this tirtha at the sea they came to prabhaasa, where they offered libations to the pitris and gods, and where yudhishthira practised austerities for twelve days, subsisting upon air and water, and performing ablutions day and night, surrounded by fires kindled on all sides. there came to them balaraama, krishna, shaamba, etc kaarshni, the grandson of shini, and other vrishnis, and heard what had happened to them, and wept when they saw the paandavas so exceedingly lean . bala raama . saatyaki, citing shaibya, etc who did the work for yayaati, recommended that raama, krishna, pradyumna, shaamba, himself, aniruddha, gada, ulmuka, baahuka, bhaanu, nitha, the young hero nishatha, saarana, and caarudeshna should lead the united army of the vrishnis, bhojas, andhakas, saattvatas, and shuras against the dhaarta raashtras and kill them in battle, and that abhimanyu should rule the earth until yudhishthira had fulfilled his vow. krishna said that the paandavas would never accept the sovereignty unless it were won by their own prowess, and yudhishthira assented to the words of krishna, saying, that as krishna alone knew him, so he alone knew krishna, who would perceive when the time had come for bravery, and he and saatyaki would then defeat suyodhana. then the yadus returned home, and the paandavas continued their journey accompanied by lomasha, and came to the river payoshni . lomasha spoke of sacrifices that had formerly been performed at the payoshni he who bathed in the payoshni would obtain the same lokas as gaya. having bathed in the payoshni they went to vaiduryaparvata and narmadaa, where they, according to the exposition of lomasha, visited all the tirthas and shrines, giving gifts to the brahmans by thousands. lomasha said that this was the junction between the tretaa and dvaapara age, where a person is freed of all his sins, and that here was performed the sacrifice of sharyaati, yudhishthira wished to hear more about it . sukanyopaakhyaana . lomasha recommended to yudhishthira to visit the above named lake, and sikataaksha, and the saindhava wood, and pushkara, and aarcikaparvata . here the rishis eat rice boiled in milk. here is the yamunaa, where krishna performed austerities there is the holy spring of indra, where dhaatri, vidhaatri, and varuna rose upwards. in the yamunaa maandhaatri and somaka saahadevi performed sacrifices . maandhaatrupaa khyaana . jantupaakhyaana . plakshaavatarana gamana . shyenakapotiya . when they arrived at the hermitage of shvetaketu

. b . bhishma said there was once a brahman jaajali, living in a forest he proceeded to the sea shore and practised penances for many years. living within the waters he roamed through all the worlds with the speed of mind. once, unseen by ra he thought there is none equal to me psh. said to him that even the celebrated tulaadhaara was not worthy of saying such words. ri. wished to see tulaadhaara ra. raised him from the sea and showed him the road. arrived at vaaraanasi, he met tulaadhaara and spoke to him thus. asked by yudhishthira, bhishma described those difficult feats that jaajali had performed before while he stood as a wooden post rapt in yoga, a pair of kulinga birds built their nest on his head, laid their eggs there, their young ones came out, and only when the latter did not come back, even after a month, jaajali left that spot. then he began to slap his armpits and proclaim loudly have won great merit. then an invisible voice in the sky said thou art not equal to the wise tulaadhaara at vaaraanasi even he is not fit to say what thou sayest. jaajali, filled with wrath and desirous of meeting with tulaadhaara, began to roam over the whole earth, observing the vow of silence and passing the night at that spot where evening overtook him. after a considerable time he reached vaaraanasi and saw tulaadhaara engaged in selling miscellaneous articles . tulaa dhaara stood up and saluted him, mentioning his dealings with the birds, etc. . asked by jaajali, the vaishya tulaadhaara discoursed to him upon the ways of morality in every creature that is endued with the five senses live all the deities, surya, etc. the goat is agni the sheep is varuna the horse is surya earth is viraaj the cow and the calf are soma the man that sells these can never obtain success...in days of yore many ri. rebuked nahusha for having slain a cow and a bull in order to purify nahusha, however, they divided that sin in parts, and converting the fragments into diseases, threw them among all creatures, but declared that they should not be able to pour libations in his sacrifice . jaajali said that tulaadhaaras trines smacked of atheism, which the latter denied, discoursing on sacrifice, saying that brahmans, having given up the sacrifice ordained for them, had betaken themselves to the performance of sacrifices that are for kshatriyas . instead of all animals the rice ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices all rivers are as sacred as the sarasvati, and all mountains are sacred the soul is itself a tirtha not wander about on the earth to visit sacred places . tulaadhaara caused jaajali to summon the birds that had been reared by the latter they made answer agreeably to the religion of ahimsaa . faith is the daughter of surya, etc quoting a verse sung by brahmaan, exalting faith the food of a liberal usurer is acceptable, but not the food of a miser ...want of faith is a high sin faith is a cleanser of sins. after a short while, tulaadhaara and jaajali both ascended to heaven. many truths of this kind were spoken of by tulaadhaara jaajali, having heard his words, betook himself to tranquillity .

the urine of that bull, as his master had formerly e. coming to the abode of paushya, he could not discover the queen before he had purified himself properly from the leavings of his last meal. he and paushya cursed one another. having obtained the ear rings, u. returned to his master. on the road takshaka, the king of the serpents, in the shape of a mendicant, stole the ear rings and proceeded to naagaloka. indra, with the thunderbolt, made a hole through which u. entered the naagaloka, where he hymned the serpents. he there saw two damsels sitting over a loom, weaving a fabric with black and white threads, further, he saw a wheel with twelve spokes turned by six boys, and then a man mounted on a horse . at the injunction of the man u. blew into the anus of the horse, whence there issued flames of fire with smoke, which were about to consume the naagaloka. takshaka then gave back the ear rings and u. was borne by the horse to his masters abode. his master explained to him all he had seen during his journey. u. then proceeded to haastinapura and told janamejaya, who had some time before returned victorious from takshashilaa, to burn takshaka, who had bitten parikshit to death, and caused kaashyapa to turn back without relieving parikshit, at a snake sacrifice, . b, . b when krishna, on his way from haastinapura to dvaarakaa, had entered the desert, he beheld u who enquired whether he came after having reconciled the kurus and the paandavas. krishna told him the matter filled with wrath u. threatened to curse him krishna warned u. against destroying his penances . u.

etc. dharma, whose essence is compassion for all creatures, is my eldest born offspring, and has sprung from my mind am vishnu, brahmaan, and shakra . he always acts as those beings in whose order he lives . u. pre vailed upon krishna to show him his eternal vaishnava or universal form, and praised krishna, who granted him the boon to have water wherever he wished for it by thinking of krishna. once, when u. was wandering thirsty in the desert, and thought of krishna, he saw a naked caandaala all besmeared with dirt, surrounded by a pack of s, and carrying a sword, and bow, and arrows from his urinary organs there issued copious streams of water he invited u. to accept this water u. refused and even censured krishna, the caandaala dis appeared. krishna came and said that the caandaala was indra, whom he had ordered to give amrita to u. in the form of water, and that indra at first had refused to it, but at last had agreed on the condition that u. should accept it in that way. krishna ordained that on those days in which u. would feel a desire for water, there should rise clouds raining savoury water over this desert and that they should be named u. clouds even to this day such clouds shower rain on the arid desert asked by janamejaya about the penances of u vaishampaayana related that u.s preceptor gautama, having permitted thousands of disciples to return home, was so pleased with the devotion of u. that he would not dismiss him, even after years, and decrepitude over took u. one day when he threw the load of fuel he had fetched on the earth, one of his matted locks, white as silver, had become entangled with the load and fell on the earth beholding that sign of old age, u. gave himself up to loud lamentations the beautiful daughter of his preceptor, at the command of her father, sought to hold the tears of u. in her hands, but her hands seemed to burn with the dropping tears, and she was obliged to let them fall on the earth the earth was unable to hold them. asked by gautama, u. explained the matter. gautama permitted him to leave him as u. spoke of the fee, gautama said that he was already highly gratified and that if u. became a young man of sixteen years, he would give him his daughter in marriage. u. again became a youth and accepted the maiden. as he spoke of the fee to his preceptors wife, ahalyaa said that she was already gratified. u however, insisted, and ahalyaa then commanded him to bring her the celestial ear rings which were borne by the wife of saudaasa, who had become a cannibal. gautama blamed ahalyaa that she had sent u. to the cannibal. ahalyaa said that she had e it unknowingly, and that gautama would protect u. u. met saudaasa in a deserted forest . saudaasa was of frightful mien, wearing a long beard smeared with human blood, and looking like a second yama he congratulated himself that he had met u. at the sixth hour of the day when he was in search of food u. maintained that while one is employed for the sake of his preceptor, one should not be injured at last they agreed that when he had brought his preceptor the ear rings he should come back saudaasa told u. to go and see the queen madayanti, as he could not himself see her at the sixth hour. madayanti told u. to bring her some sign from her husband, as these ear rings, when placed on the earth, would be stolen by the naagas, if worn by one who is impure from eating, they would be taken away by the yakshas, and if the wearer fell asleep, the gods would take them away also the maharshis and the raakshasas watch for opportunities for carrying them away they always produce gold and shine brightly at night they protect against hunger, and thirst, and fear, and he who wears them grows in size . u. came back to saudaasa, who gave him a sign. when he had got the ear rings, u. once more came back to saudaasa, and asked him about the meaning of the mystic words he had caused him to say to madayanti, as a sign. saudaasa, referring to his own terrible condition in consequence of his being cursed, said that he hoped that this gift to a brahman might save him. u. asked saudaasa to give him such advice as is approved by the wise is it proper for me to come back to thee or not saudaasa said that he would then tell him never to come back. when u on his way to ahalyaa, having bound the ear rings in the folds of his black deerskin, had proceeded for some distance he became afflicted with hunger and climbed a bilva tree, hanging his deerskin on a branch, while he plucked some fruits. struck by some fruits the deerskin fell n, the knot was untied, and a serpent of airaavatas race carried the ear rings, holding them in his mouth, into an anthill. filled with wrath, u. with his staff, pierced that anthill for thirty five days, desirous of making a path to the nether regions the goddess earth became anxious indra came there in the disguise of a brahman afflicted with the sorrow of u and told him that the regions of the naagas are thousands of yojanas distant as u. did not desist, indra united the latters staff with his thunderbolt, and struck with the thunderbolt, the earth opened a way to the naagaloka . u. entered the naagaloka, very cheerless then there appeared to him a black steed with a white tail, whose face and eyes were of coppery hue. he told u. to blow into his anus, which thou often didst at the retreat of gautama in former days the horse turned out to be agni u. did as he was directed, a thick smoke enveloped the naagaloka, the naagas, headed by vaasuki, gave u. the ear rings, which he

. . as yudhishthira wished to hear about the greatness of brahmans, maarkandeya related king parikshit, in ayodhyaa, of the race of ikshvaaku, was, in the forest, led far away by a deer, and by a tank met with a beautiful maiden, who came along singing. he married her after having given her the pledge not to let her see water, and having arrived at his capital he lived with her in privacy, and nobody could obtain any interview with him. his chief minister, having found out the matter, made an artificial forest, with a tank covered with a net of pearls, and showed it to the king. the king told his wife to plunge into this tank. she did so, and did not reappear. when the water had been baled out a frog was found. the king ordered all frogs to be slaughtered. aayu, the king of the frogs, in the shape of an ascetic, told him that the queen was his daughter sushobhanaa, who had deceived many kings. she was restored to the king, but aayu cursed her, saying thy offspring shall prove disrespectful to brahmans. parikshit begot three sons on her shala, dala, and bala. having installed shala on the throne, parikshit retired to the wood. one shala, as he could not overtake a deer, forced his charioteer to indicate to him, to whom the vaamya horses be longed. he borrowed them from the rishi vaamadeva and caught the deer, but did not return them. after a month, vaamadeva in vain sent his disciple aatreya, and then came himself, and asked for the steeds. the king, saying that such horses were not fit for brahmans, in vain offered to give him two bulls, then four asses or four mules, and as he threatened to let him be killed, vaamadeva, saying that brahmans could not be punished, let four raakshasas slay him with their lances. dala, whom the ikshvaakus installed on the throne, attempted to shoot vaamadeva with a poisoned arrow, but shot his own son shyenajit, and was unable to discharge another poisoned arrow. then he gave way, and, advised by vaamadeva, he touched his queen with the arrow and was thus purified of his sin. the queen obtained the boon from vaamadeva, that she might prevail upon her husband that they both should serve the brahmans, and he be freed from his sin, and that vaamadeva should think of their weal. the king became glad and restored the vaamya horses .

vaasishtha . . arjuna wished to hear about vasishtha. the gandharva said vasishtha is brahmaans spiritual son and arundhatis husband kaama and krodha, who cannot be vanquished even by the immortals, used to shampoo his feet. though his wrath was excited by vishvaamitras offence, he did not yet exterminate the kushikas. afflicted at the loss of his sons, he did not any dreadful deed for the destruction of vishvaamitra. he did not transgress kritaanta in order to bring back his lost children from the abode of yama. it was by obtaining him that the ikshvaakus acquired this earth, and with him as their purohita, they performed many great sacrifices. therefore acquire a fit purohita . arjuna wished to hear of the hostility between vishvaamitra and vasishtha. the gandharva said this old story of vasishtha they tell in all worlds. in kaanyakubja king gaadhi, son of kushika, had a son vishvaamitra, who, with his ministers, used to go a hunting. once he arrived at the hermitage of vasishtha, who offered him arghya, etc. from his cow nandini, who yielded everything desired vishvaamitra asked vasishtha to give him nandini for an arbuda of kine or his king, but in vain. then he wanted to take the cow by force. she repaired to vasishtha, who at first did nothing, saying, am a forgiving brahman but at last he said not aban you stay if you can hearing this word, the cow attacked vishvaamitras troops from her tail she began to rain showers of burning coals from her tail she brought forth pahlavas, from her udders draavidas and shakas, from her womb yavanas, from her dung shabaras, from her urine kaancis, and from her sides sharabhas, and from the froth of her mouth paundras, kiraatas, yavanas, simhalas, barbaras, vashas, civukas, pulindas, cinas, hunas, keralas, and other mlecchas, who attacked vishvaamitras soldiers. vishvaamitras troops fied, but none was deprived of life. vishvaamitra then, disgusted with kshatriya prowess, set his mind on asceticism, and finally became a brahman and drank soma with indra . kalmaashapaada . vasishtha patiently bore his grief, and resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate the kaushikas. he threw himself n from the summit of meru, entered a huge fire in the forest, and tied a strong weight to his neck and threw himself into the sea, but all in vain, and, in distress of heart, he returned to his hermitage . beholding it bereft of his children, he left it again and tied himself strongly with cords and flung himself into a mighty river, but the stream cut those cords and cast the rishi ashore, whence that river was called vipaashaa. once more he threw himself into a river flowing from himavat, but the river immediately fled in different directions, and has since been known by the name of the shatadru . he now again went towards his hermitage, and was on the way addressed by adrishyanti, the wife of shaktri, who had for twelve years borne his child in her womb. hearing that child in the womb reciting the vedas with the six angas, vasishtha refrained from self destruction, and, accompanied by adrishyanti, returned to his hermitage. one day he saw kalmaashapaada, who would devour him adrishyanti was terrified, but vasishtha restrained him by uttering hum, and, sprinkling him with water sanctified by mantras, and freed him from his curse that had lasted twelve years. kalmaashapaada promised never more to insult brahmans, and prevailed upon vasishtha that he accompanied him to his capital ayodhyaa and begat a son for him on the queen. then he went back to his hermitage. after twelve years the queen tore open her womb by a stone, and then was born the raajarshi ashmaka, who founded the city of paudanya . paraashara .
vasishthaapavaaha, name of a tirtha . p a great enmity arose between vishvaamitra and vasishtha, due to their rivalry in respect of ascetic austerities. the hermitage of vasishtha was in sthaanutirtha, on the bank of the sarasvati on the opposite bank was the hermitage of vishvaamitra. there sthaanu had practised penances, and having performed a sacrifice and worshipped the sarasvati he had established that tirtha, and there the gods in days of yore installed skanda. in that tirtha on the sarasvati, the rishi vishvaamitra, by his penances, disturbed vasishtha. vishvaamitra and vasishtha every day challenged each other in respect of the superiority of their penances. vishvaamitra ordered the sarasvati, notwithstanding her trembling, to bring vasishtha into his presence, that he might slay him. vasishtha willingly let her so, lest vishvaamitra should curse her. sarasvati washed away one of her banks and bore vasishtha away and informed kaushika about his arrival but while vishvaamitra was looking for a weapon she quickly bore vasishtha back to the eastern bank. vishvaamitra cursed her, saying that her current should be changed into blood, which is acceptable only to the raakshasas. for a whole year she then flowed bearing blood mixed with water. the gods, the gandharvas, and the apsarases grieved. for this reason the tirtha came to be called . sarasvati, however, once more got back her own proper condition, when some munis on a tirthayaatraa to the sarasvati, having bathed in all her tirthas came to . and saw the water mixed with blood, and that innumerable raakshasas were drinking it. having learnt the cause, they worshipped mahaadeva with penances and purified the sarasvati. the raakshasas, who were brahma raakshasas, afflicted with hunger, sought the protection of the munis, who, having ordained what should be the food of the raakshasas solicited the sarasvati, who assumed a new shape called arunaa bathing in that new river the raakshasas abaned their bodies and went to heaven. ascertaining all this, indra bathed there and became purified of a grievous sin, .
vaasishthi, a tirtha .
. . arjuna asked why did kalmaashapaada command his queen to go to vasishtha and was this an act of sin on the part of vasishtha the gandharva said under the influence of the curse, kalmaashapaada, in anger, went out of his capital, accompanied by his wife. in a solitary part of the woods he saw a brahman and his wife embracing each other. the couple ran away, but kalmaashapaada forcibly seized the brahman. the braahmani asked him to liberate her husband, but he cruelly devoured him. the tears that the woman shed blazed up like fire and consumed everything in that place. the braahmani cursed the raajarshi, saying that he should meet with instant death when cohabit ing with his wife, and that his wife should have a son from vasishtha, whose children he had devoured, and that child should be the propagator of his race. then she entered the fire. vasishtha, by his ascetic power, immediately knew all about it. and long after this, when the raajarshi became freed from his curse, he approached his wife madayanti, not remembering the curse of the braahmani. hearing, however, the words of his wife, he recollected the curse, and, therefore, he appointed vasishtha to beget a son on his queen .

vidulaaputrashaasana . the princess vidulaa one day rebuked her son sanjaya, who, being defeated by the king of the sindhus, was lying dejected. without wrath, as thou art, thou canst not be counted as a man...it is better to blaze up for a moment than to smoke for a long time...he who has not achieved a great feat, forming the subject of mens conversation, only increases the number of men he is neither man nor woman ...it behoves thee not to at the idle, wretched, infamous, and miserable profession of mendicancy that is worthy only of a coward...he is a man who cherishes wrath and s not forgive......the followers of the sindhu king are all discontented and waiting for the distress of their master others will come to thee with their auxiliaries if they behold thee put forth thy prowess... while thou wert a child, a brahman said this one, falling into great distress, will again win greatness. shambara has said there is not a more miserable state than that in which one s not see how to procure his food from day to day. by slaying vritra, indra became mahendra, and obtained the soma cup of mahendra, and the lordship of all the worlds...sovereignty is either the r of heaven or amrita... in the possession of wealth, rejoice, as before, with the sauvira maidens, and be not ruled over by the saindhava maidens...handed n by tradition from time immemorial, the eternal essence of kshatriya virtues has been ordained by prajaapati himself... a kshatriya should rather break than yield. he should bow n to brahmans only and to virtue he should rule over all other orders, destroying all evil rs . the son complained that the heart of his mother was made of steel, and blamed the kshatriya practices. vidulaa said that if sanjaya was about to be stained by infamy and she did not say it to him, her affection for him would be like that of a she ass for her young. he ought to have recourse to virtue and profit ...we have many treasure houses unknown to thee...thou hast also more than one friend. despair left sanjayas heart, though he was not gifted with great intelligence. he roused himself and achieved all that his mother had pointed out. indeed, this history, named jaya, should be listened to by everyone desirous of victory, etc. .

b . bhishma said there was, in days of yore, a ri. devasharaman his beautiful wife ruci fascinated every one who saw her, both g and daa and particularly indra. devasharman knew very well the disposition of women, as well as indras coveting other mens wives. once, desirous of performing a sacrifice, he summoned his favourite disciple vipula bhaargava, and asked him, during his absence, to protect ruci against indra, describing to him the disguises that indra assumes . vipula, by his yoga power, entered the body of ruci . indra came, but ruci was unable to move or to utter a word in reply then, influenced by vipula, she answered in sanskrit words that she did not intend to utter. indra became perplexed, and when he with his spiritual eye discovered vipula within ruci, he became afraid that he might curse him. vipula left the body of ruci and returned to his own body which was lying near, and rebuked indra, mention ing gautamas curse, owing to which indras body became disfigured with, sex marks, which, owing to gautamas compassion, were afterwards changed into eyes, see that thou t not, with thy sons and counselors, meet with destruction. shakra, overwhelmed with shame, made himself invisible. a moment after, devasharman came back, and granted vipula the boon that he should never swerve away from righteousness dismissed by his preceptor, vipula left his abode and practised the most severe austerities. deva sharman also, with his spouse, began to live in the woods, perfectly fearless of indra . vipula became full of pride. after some time the occasion came for a ceremony of gifts, with respect to the sister of ruci the anga king citraratha. meanwhile, a celestial damsel dropped some flowers n to the earth they were picked up by ruci, who, aned with them, went to the palace of the anga king. her sister, prabhaavati, the anga queen, urged her to obtain some for her, and ruci informed her husband, who, summoning vipula, commanded him to bring him some flowers of the same kind. vipula found some such flowers still lying scattered, quite fresh, and set out for campaa on his way he saw a human couple moving in a circle, hand in hand a dispute arose between them, and at last, each of them took the oath that one of us who speaks falsely shall, in the next world, meet with the end which will be vipulas. vipula became very sad proceeding a little way he beheld six other men playing with dice made of gold and silver they were heard by vipula to take the same oath as the first couple. at last he recollected the manner in which he had acted in protecting his preceptors wife, without telling his preceptor the truth. coming to campaa, he gave the flowers to his preceptor . devasharman, too, knew what he had seen on his way, and how he had acted in protecting ruci he explained that the first couple were day and night, the others the six seasons. he absolved vipula and ascended to heaven with his wife and his disciple. maarkandeya had narrated this tale to bhishma on the banks of the gangaa .

. . the paandavas, etc returned to the hermitage of naaraayana. once yudhishthira said to them we have passed these four years in the woods it has been appointed by arjuna, that after the fifth year he will come to the mountain shveta. they then set out with the brahmans and the raakshasas, and protected by lomasha, sometimes going on foot, sometimes carried by the raakshasas, towards the north, beholding on the way the mountains mainaaka, gandhamaadana, and shveta, and on the seventeenth day they reached the slopes of himavat, not far from gandhamaadana, and were received by r. ri. vrishaparvan in his hermitage, where they passed seven nights. on the eighth day they entrusted their remaining robes, their sacrificial vessels, ornaments, and jewels to vrishaparvan, and, following his instructions, set out for the north, on foot, with dhaumya, krishnaa, and lomasha. on the fourth day they reached shveta, and entered gandhamaadana with draupadi and the brahmans, and saw the great gangaa . thereafter, they went to the hermitage of aarshtishena . aarshtishena received the four paandavas and krishna and dhaumya, and said that during the parvan days rishis living upon water and air and moving through the sky come to this mountain, sounds of kettledrums, etc being heard on the summits, and that they should not attempt to proceed further, but wait for arjuna there, as they could not go beyond kailaasa . . they passed the fifth year in the hermitage of aarshtishena, eating flesh of deer killed with unpoisoned shafts, listening to the stories told by lomasha. ghatotkaca had departed, promising to be present when occasion arose. munis and caaranas visited them. one day suparna carried off a mighty naaga from the lake, while the mountain trembled, etc and the wind, raised by suparnas wings, brought celestial flowers of five colours before the paandavas towards the river ashvarathaa. krishnaa expressed to bhima the wish of seeing the top of the mountain when he had driven away the raakshasas. bhima set out with bow, sword, and mace, and having ascended the summit, thereby gladdening kinnaras, naagas, munis, gan dharvas, and raakshasas, he blew his shell. yakshas and raakshasas assailed him with maces, clubs, etc but were killed or defeated, and the surviving fled towards the south, forsaking their weapons. the raakshasa manimat, the friend of kubera, in vain attempted to recall them, and with clubs, javelins, etc he rushed at bhima and pierced his right arm with an iron spear with a golden haft, but at last was killed by bhima with his mace. the surviving raakshasas went towards the east . . hearing various sounds and not seeing bhima, the paandavas and krishnaa, and dhaumya and the brahmans were filled with anxiety, and, entrusting draupadi to the charge of aarshtishena, they ascended the summit of the mountain and embraced bhima, who was censured and again warned by yudhishthira. kubera, on hearing about the matter from the raakshasas, in anger let yoke his carriage, and, eulogized by the gods and gandharvas, and surrounded by, yakshas, he set out through the firmament to gandhamaadana, where he seated himself on his seat pushpaka, surrounded by yakshas, raakshasas, gandharvas, and apsarases, with his noose and sword and bow, and asked yudhishthira not to be angry with bhima as bhima had only been the instrument of destiny, and said to bhima that he did not mind his act of rashness as he had thereby been delivered from the curse of agastya . kubera then gave yudhishthira some wise counsel, referring to the krita yuga he said, that yudhishthira ought to check the rashness of bhimasena they should return to the hermitage of the r. ri aarshtishena and reside there during the first dark fortnight the inhabitants of alakaa with gandharvas, and yakshas with kinnaras, etc should, at the command of kubera, protect them, and his servants procure for them meat and drink he praised arjuna . arjuna would soon join them. then kubera went to the mountain asta, followed by thousands of yakshas and raakshasas in vehicles drawn by horses flying in the air. the dead bodies of the raakshasas were, at the command of kubera, removed. the paandavas dwelt several nights there, being honoured by the raakshasas . . at sunrise, dhaumya and aarshtishena came to them, and dhaumya, seizing yudhishthiras hands, pointed out, towards the east, the mandara mountain, the east being the region of indra and vaishravana, as the south is that of yama with his abode samyamana, and the asta mountain, where the sun sets in the west, that of varuna, together with the ocean in the north meru, with the dwelling of brahmaan, where prajaapati creates all creatures, and the seven mind born sons of brahmaan, and where the seven devarshis, with vasishtha at their head, rise and set next, to the east of meru, the abode of naaraayana or vishnu, that cannot be seen by gods or daanavas, and where even brahmarshis have no access, not to speak of maharshis, but only yatis thence, they not return to this world vishnu alone shines there. description of the revolving around meru of the sun, moon, and stars . . the paandavas dwelled there for a month, visited by gandharvas and maharshis. a night and a day became to them like a year, for since the departure of arjuna, they had not felt joy. after having dwelt for five years in the abode of indra and obtained all celestial weapons from him, aagneya, vaaruna, saumya, vaayavya, vaishnava, aindra, paashuvata, braahmya, paarameshthya, and those of prajaapati, yama,

afraid of the allies of yudhishthira the paancaalas, kekayas, etc. . sanjaya rebuked dhritaraashtra for his behaviour towards the paandavas the matsyas, etc. all decline to pay thee homage now .

king the people of the realm were all annoyed with us, and all our friends also were angry with us but bhishma, kripa, and ashvatthaaman had despised the foes . now the paandavas are without allies and all these kings can, for my sake, enter the fire or the sea...having given up all hopes of a town, yudhishthira craves only five villages...there is none on earth equal to me in an encounter with the mace. in battle, am sankarshanas equal will certainly slay bhima, bhishma, etc every one of these is singly capable of slaying the paandavas. he alluded to the superhuman circumstances concerning

nakula uluka, saarasvataa. all the other kings had been distributed in their respective shares. thus the paandava host had been distributed into divisions. viraata with all his matsya warriors would support shikhandin. dhritaraashtra was exceedingly afraid of yudhishthira, etc duryodhana said that bhishma, etc. were invincible. dhritaraashtra maintained that bhishma did not wish a battle. sanjaya said that dhrishtadyumna was always urging the paandavas to fight, and professed that he would alone encounter all the assembled kings bhishma, etc and his words were approved by yudhishthira dhrishtadyumna had told sanjaya to say to the kurus, etc that they ought not to suffer themselves to be slain by arjuna, who was protected by the celestials they should send a good man to yudhi shthira and entreat him to accept the king. . dhritaraashtra men tioned that yudhishthira led the brahmacarya mode of life from his very youth, and saying that he himself, etc. did not applaud war, he urged duryodhana to desist from hostilities and give back to the paandavas their king, saying, that it was karna, dushaasana, and shakuni who led duryodhana astray. duryodhana answered that, without depending upon dhritaraashtra, etc he and karna and dushaasana would perform, in honour of yama, a sacrifice in battle and slay the paandavas he said that he would sacrifice his life rather than surrender to the paandavas even that much of land which may be covered by the sharp point of a needle. dhritaraashtra said that he abaned duryodhana for ever, and grieved for the kings who would be crushed by yuyudhaana, etc. . at the request of dhrita raashtra, sanjaya related how he had entered the inner apart ments in order to inform arjuna and krishna he had seen two straight lines on arjunas foot soles. krishna had threatened the kurus, mentioning that krishnaa had in voked him with tears, and that as men, y g and n. were incapable of encountering arjuna in battle, and alluding to his exploits in the city of viraata . dhritaraashtra represented to duryodhana that agni would help arjuna, remembering what was e to him at khaandava, that dharma, etc would help the paandavas from parental affection, that arjuna took up arrows at a time, that bhishma, etc. regarded him as invincible, and said he desired peace . duryodhana, inflamed with wrath, said that according to vyaasa, naarada, and parashu raama, the gods never engaged in work if agni, vaayu, dharma, indra, or the ashvins had ever engaged in work, the paarthas could never have fallen into distress, and they and the maruts would not venture to protect his foes charmed by me, agni will be instantly extinguished.. my energy is greater than that of the gods...it is who set agoing all the affairs of both gods and asuras... neither . nor g nor as. nor raa. are capable of saving him who has incurred my displeasure... thou wilt hear of the defeat of the paandavas, etc. ...whatever knowledge of weapons there is in bhishma, etc exists in me as well . karna said to duryodhana, mentioning the curse of parashu raama, when he, by a lie, obtained the braahma weapon from him, that he would slay the paancaalas, etc. . bhishma mentioned the khaandava forest, and said that the dart which karna had got from indra, would be reduced to ashes by krishna with his discus, and that his other shaft, which he respectfully wor shipped with flowery garlands, would be destroyed by arjuna because he was protected by krishna. karna made the pledge not to fight before bhishmas fall, and went to his own abode. bhishma ridiculed karnas boasting before the kings of avanti, etc. . duryodhana boasted vidura praised self restraint . vidura related that once two birds had flown away with the net in which they were caught, but were again caught when they began to quarrel. so it is also with kinsmen. once we, with some hunters and brahmans conversant with magic and charms, repaired to the northern mountain gandhamaadana, with excellent medicinal herbs, and inhabited by si. and g. there was, on a pre cipice, some honey, kuberas favourite drink, guarded by poisonous snakes the brahmans said that a mortal drinking of it would win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight, and an old man would become a youth. the hunters desired to obtain it, and all perished. so it is with duryodhana. in a single chariot arjuna conquered the whole earth bhishma and drona, etc. were routed by him at the city of viraata. remember also drupada and the king of the matsyas . dhritaraashtra warned duryodhana against the paandavas, etc and recommended him to follow bhishma, etc. as his guides, mentioning the combat at the city of viraata . at the request of dhritaraashtra, sanjaya related that arjuna had said that bhishma, etc. were all on the eve of death, if they did not give up to yudhishthira his own share of the king . as duryodhana showed little regard for the words of sanjaya, and the rest remained silent, the assembled kings rose and retired. dhritaraashtra, who always followed the counsels of his son, began to inquire in secret of sanjaya about the resolves of his own party and of the foes. sanjaya caused him to let vidura introduce vyaasa and gaandhaari . sanjaya extolled krishna, and mentioned some of those whom he had vanquished . discourse between dhritaraashtra and sanjaya on the attributes of krishna. dhritaraashtra told duryodhana to seek refuge with krishna. duryodhana refused. dhritaraashtra complained of him to gaandhaari. gaandhaari threatened duryodhana with bhimasena. vyaasa recommended to dhritaraashtra to seek salvation through krishna. requested by dhritaraashtra, sanjaya explained the path of salvation through krishna . at the request of dhritaraashtra, sanjaya enumerated some names of krishna . dhritaraashtra complained that he could not see krishna, whom he extolled under several names .

. . the learned raibhya and the rishi bharadvaaja were friends. raibhya had two learned sons, arvaavasu and paraavasu bharadvaaja only one son, yavakrita. as yavakrita saw that raibhya and his sons were esteemed by the brahmans, while bharadvaaja was slighted, he practised austerities in order to acquire vedic knowledge for himself and his father instead of acquiring it from a teacher during a long time. indra was alarmed, and twice he in vain attempted to make yavakrita desist from his penances, saying that they never could be successful. as yavakrita declared that he would cut off his limbs and sacrifice them in the fire, indra assumed the guise of an old decrepit brahman, and began to throw up a dam of sand at that spot of the bhaagirathi where yavakrita used to bathe, and declared that yavakritas intentions were equally im possible. then yavakrita desisted from his plan, and indra granted him that the vedas should be revealed to him and his father, and that he should excel other men. bharadvaaja said that yavakrita would become proud and uncharitable and thence destruction would soon overtake him, and told him some gaathaas, narrated by the gods, about medhaavin . . bharadvaaja made yavakrita promise to shun the irritable raibhya and his sons, and yavakrita began to offend other rishis . once, in the month of maadhava, he came to the hermitage of raibhya and seduced the wife of paraavasu. when raibhya came home and saw what had happened, he offered in the fire two matted locks of his hair, whence sprang out a woman resembling his daughter in law, who robbed yavakrita of his water pot, and a rakshas, who flew at him with his uplifted spear, as he had been deprived of his water pot and rendered unclean . yavakrita fled to a tank and then to all the rivers, and, finding them all devoid of water, he attempted to enter into the agnihotra room of his father, but was stopped at the r by a blind shudra warder, and killed by the rakshas. the rakshas, with the permission of raibhya, began to live with the female . when bharadvaaja returned home, the sacrificial fires, which used to welcome him every did not come forward to welcome him. having heard from the shudra what had happened, he cursed raibhya, saying that he should be killed by his eldest son. he cremated yavakrita, and then himself entered the fire . at that time king brihaddyumna, the yaajya of raibhya, employed arvaavasu and paraavasu at a sacrifice, while raibhya stayed at home with the wife of paraavasu. one day paraavasu, returning home to see his wife, met in the darkness his father in the wood wrapped in the skin of a black antelope, and, mistaking him for a deer, killed him. then, after having performed the funeral rites of his father, he prevailed upon arvaavasu to observe the vow prescribed in the case of killing a brahman, while he himself conducted the sacrifice alone. when arvaavasu came back, having observed the vow, paraavasu caused him to be driven away from the sacrifice as a slayer of a brahman. the brahmarshi arvaavasu went to the wood, and, applying to the sun, he practised austerities and mastered the rahasyaveda of the sun. the sun appeared to him in his embodied form, and said the gods were pleased by him. they elected arvaavasu and rejected paraavasu. the gods agni, etc granted him the boon that raibhya, bharadvaaja, and yavakrita revived, that paraavasu was absolved from his sin, that raibhya did not recollect his having been slain, and that the saura veda should attain celebrity . the gods explained to yavakrita that raibhya had been able to kill him because he had acquired his knowledge with great exertion and in the course of a long time, while yavakrita had learnt the vedas without exertion and without a guru. then indra and the gods returned to heaven .

yayaati, an ancient king, son of nahusha bis . having, after, years, been attacked with decrepitude, y. asked his sons, one by one, to give him their youth and take upon them his decrepitude, but only the youngest, puru, yielded to his wish, and taking upon himself the old age of y. he ruled the king, while y as strong as a tiger, enjoyed the company of his two wives and, in the caitra ratha wood, of vishvaaci, but without becoming satiated. he then recited some verses and took back from his son his own decrepitude, giving him back his youth. he then installed puru on the throne, saying that he was his true heir, and should continue the lineage which should be named after him. y. then retired to bhrigutunga, and having spent a long time in ascetism, observing the vow of fasting, he died and ascended to heaven with his wives, . y. transferred his decrepitude to puru, etc. and cursed his other sons, yadu, turvasu, druhyu, anu . y. sported with vishvaaci in the nandana wood and in alakaa, and in the northern summit of meru. y. then recited some verses and installed puru as king . the offspring of yadu, turvasu, druhyu, anu, and puru, . having installed puru on the throne, y. entered the wood to lead the life of a hermit for, years and then ascended to svarga, where he was reverenced by the gods, the saadhyas, the maruts, and the vasus, wandering about in devaloka and brahmaloka. one day indra asked him what he had said to puru when he bestowed the king upon him. y. answered that he had said the whole country between the gangaa and the yamunaa is thine, this is the central region of the earth, the outlying regions will be the inions of thy brothers. those without anger are ever superior to those under its sway, etc. . as y. said that he did not know his equal in ascetic austerities among men, gods, gandharvas, and maharshis, indra declared that, owing to this haughtiness, he should fall from heaven, yet he should fall among the virtuous. when falling, he was beheld by the raajarshi ashtaka, of whom he was the maternal grandfather y. spoke disapprovingly of haughtiness, etc and told that, leaving earth, he had obtained many high regions for, years, then he had dwelt in the town of indra for, years, then for, years in the world of prajaapati, then in the abode of devadeva he had also dwelt in nandana for ayutas of years, assuming any form at will, sporting with the apsarases then there had come a messenger of the gods with a grim visage, who thrice had shouted to him fall then he had fallen from nandana, hearing, while falling, the compassionate exclamations of the gods, who had directed him to fall to the sacrificial place of ashtaka and his companions . y. continued those who speak of their own merits after having dwelt for, or, years in heaven, are med to suffer the pains of the hell called bhauma, and are attacked by certain raakshasas with sharp teeth. y. then taught the lore of transmigration and emancipation . y. explained the duties of grihasthas, bhikshus, brahmacaarins, and vaanaprasthas, and the different kinds of munis and mauna . y. then said now shall fall into the bhauma hell, the lokapas of brahmaan hasten me thither. the kings ashtaka, pratardana, vasu manas aushadashvi, and shibi aushinara, offered him their lokas and volunteered to go to hell in his place y. did not accept the offer. then appeared five golden chariots, in which they all five ascended to heaven, shibi leaving the others behind him. y. told them that he was their maternal grandfather, that he had given the whole earth with her horses, etc to brahmans, and that the earth and the firmament and fire existed owing to his truth . c y. competed with indra. on the place where he performed his sacrifice the ground is studded with places for the sacrificial fires of various forms, and the earth seems subsiding under the pressure of y.s pious works, . maarkandeya continued once when king y. naahusha was sitting on his throne, there came a brahman who asked him for wealth for his preceptor, with whom he had made the appointment always to question the giver with what feelings he would give him what he asked for. y. answered that he always felt happy when giving, etc and gave him, kine, . as y. was falling headlong towards the earth, while the kings and si. and aps. laughed, there came, at the command of indra, a person whose business it was to hurl n those whose merits were exhausted, and told him that his pride had caused his fall. y. uttered the wish that he might fall among the righteous. he fell n among his daughters sons pratardana, vasumanas, shibi, and ashtaka, in the naimisha wood, where they performed a vaajapeya sacrifice. they gave him their merits, and the result of all their sacrifices. maadhavi also came and gave him the moiety of hers, likewise gaalava, who gave him the eighth part of his . as soon as y. was recognized by those virtuous persons, he rose again to heaven without touching the surface of the earth, and his four daughters sons, in a loud voice, repeated the gift of their merits . y. was honoured in heaven by g aps . r, r. ri, and the gods. brahmaan explained to him that it was his vanity alone that had been able to destroy all his merit . naarada continued such was the distress into which y. fell in consequence of vanity and gaalava owing to his obstinacy. make peace with the sons of paandu, . b y the son of nahusha, was the sixth in descent from soma. y. had five sons yadu, the son of devayaani, and thus the grandson of shukra kaavya was the eldest, while puru, the son of sharmishthaa was the youngest. yadu humiliated all the kshatriyas. he did not obey the injunc tions of his father, but insulted his father and brothers. he established himself in the city named after the elephant . y. cursed him and expelled him from the king. he also cursed his other sons who were obedient to yadu, and placed his youngest son, puru, on the throne, . y the son of nahusha, performed raajasuya sacrifices, he gave to the brahmans the whole of the wealth in the possession of mlecchas, etc. he sided with the gods against the asuras having divided the earth into four parts,
