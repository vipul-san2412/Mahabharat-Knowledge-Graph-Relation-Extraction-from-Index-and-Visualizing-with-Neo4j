Prāṇa,son of,Prāṇa,Āṅgirasa .  Asked by Yudhiṣṭhira Mārkaṇḍeya related the following old story  Aṅgiras  in days of yore practised austerities in his hermitage so that he excelled Agni who thinking that Brahmán had created a new Fire was greatly depressed but Aṅgiras saying that Agni had been created by Brahmán to officiate as fire asked him to occupy his proper place and when Agni only wished to be the second or Prājā patyaka fire at last prevailed upon him to remain and make  him  his first son. Aṅgiras also had a son Bṛhaspati knowing him the Āṅgirasa to be the firstborn son of Fire the gods came and learned the matter from Aṅgiras . The children of Aṅgiras and Śubhā  the son Bṛhaspati and the eight daughters Bhānumatī Rāgā Sinībālī also called Kapardisutā because she was both visible and invisible Arciṣmatī Haviṣmatī Mahiṣmatī Mahāmatī and Kuhū .

With Kāśyapa Vāsiṣṭha Prāṇa son of Prāṇa Agni Āṅgirasa and Cyavana Trisvarcaka he after a penance lasting for many years obtained the son Pañcajanya . Pāñcajanya after years of penances produced the fire of the Pitṛs from his head he created Bṛhat and Rathantara from his mouth Vāta and Rasāhara in his navel Śiva from his might  Indra from his soul  Vāyu and Agni from his arms Anudāttau and Viśve  and the elements and then the five sons of the Pitṛs. Bṛhadrathas son was Praṇidhi Kāśyapas Mahattara Āṅgiras Bhānu Varcas Saubhara and Prāṇas Anudātta in all twenty five. He also produced three times five devāḥ Yajña muṣaḥ Subhīma Atibhīma Bhīma Bhīmabala Abala Sumitra Mitravaṭ Mitrajña Mitravardhana Mitradharman Surapravīra Vīra Suveśa Suravarcas and Surāṇām api hantṛ. Bṛhaduktha and Rathantara  or Mitravinda sons of Tapas . Many fires enumerated among others the five Ūrjaskarāḥ sons of Tapas the six sons of Bhānu with his wives Suprajā and Bṛhadbhāsā Sūryajā . Niśā was likewise the wife of Bhānu and gave birth to one daughter to Agni and Soma and to five Fires . The Fire  who in company with Parjanya is honoured with the first havis at the Cāturmāsyas is Agni Vaiśvānara. He who is called the lord of all the world is Viśvapati the second son of Manu etc. . Genealogy of the Fires continued. The Fire Saha from fear of his grandson the Fire Bharata who burns the dead bodies hid himself in the sea asking Atharvan to carry the oblations to the gods. When his place of concealment had been divulged by the fishes Saha cursed them saying that they should become the food of all creatures in various ways. Then Saha gave up his body and entered the earth where he created various metals from his pus  force  and scent from his bones the devadāru from his phlegm glass from his bile mārakata from his liver the black iron the clouds from his nails the corals from his veins etc and remained absorbed in meditation whence he was roused by the tapas of Bhṛgu Āṅgiras etc. Seeing the ṛṣhi he again took refuge in the water. The whole world with the gods sought the protection of Atharvan who searched the sea and finding the Fire created the worlds . So Agni was formerly destroyed by Atharvan and called back PCR. he carries the oblations and travelling about various countries and living there he produced the various fires mentioned in the Vedas. Enumeration of rivers that are said to be the mothers of the fires. The wife of Adbhuta was Priyā and his son Vibhūrasi . There are as many somas  as the number of fires mentioned. Also in the race of Atri  mind born sons of Brahmán   sprang forth. Atri wishing to procreate sons conceived these  in his mind and the fires came out of his the brahmans body. The powers of these fires are the same as those of the Adbhuta fire as related in the Vedas for they are all one and the same the first Aṅgiras sprung from  body in various forms like the jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice .

Meghasandhi,son of,Sahadeva,the th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr. cf. Anugītā. Janamejaya said When Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna after having slain their enemies dwelt there in the palace what conversation took place between them Vaiśampāyana said Arjuna having recovered his king spent his time joyously in the company of Kṛṣṇa in that beautiful palace. There they repaired to a particular part of the palace with their friends and relatives. Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to repeat to him what he had taught him before the battle especially as he would soon repair to Dvārakā. Kṛṣṇa is discontented because Arjuna cannot remember it he would now however recite an old story upon the same topic. There came a brahman from Svargaloka and was honoured by us hear what he said asked by us. The brahman said There came a brahman Kāśyapa possessed of penance etc to some other brahman who had become conversant with all the authorities on religion etc crowned with ascetic success able to move everywhere at will knowing the science of disappearing at will roving with invisible Siddhas and celestial musicians  Kāśyapa honoured him as his guru and the brahman spoke to him about transmigration comparing his own example at last he had renounced the world and attained to his present success and should not have to return to this world but would come to Bráhmans eternal abode he promised to answer Kāśyapas questions . Kṛṣṇa said Asked by Kāśyapa the brahman discoursed on how Jīva casts off and then attains to a body how Emanci pation is achieved and where acts exist when Jīva becomes divested of body etc. how death is brought about the happiness and misery of Jīva determined by acts  how Jīva enters the womb Brahmán first formed a body of his own then he created Pradhāna the material cause  of all embodied creatures indifference to pleasure and pain leads to the Supreme Seat  who is said to be emancipated on the science of yoga how Jīva attains to emancipation. Kṛṣṇa said Then the brahman disappeared this discourse was in fact what thou  heardst on thy car this is a great mystery even to the gods at no time or place has this been heard by man in this world by adhering to this religion even those who are of sinful birth women vaiśyas and śūdras attain to the highest goal yoga  takes place in his case who devotes himself to its constant practice  for a period of six months . In this connection the ancient narrative of a discourse between a married couple is cited   . Asked by Arjuna about Bráhman Kṛṣṇa recited the old story of the discourse between a preceptor and his disciple on this subject Guruśiṣyasaṃvāda . Asked by Arjuna Kṛṣṇa said that he is the preceptor and the mind his pupil formerly when the hour of battle came this very religion was declared by me and now it is long since saw my father wish to see him again with thy leave. Vaiśampāyana said Arjuna replied We shall go to day from this town to Hāstinapura and inform Yudhi ṣṭhira . Vaiśampāyana said Kṛṣṇa caused Dāruka to yoke his car and then set out for Hāstina pura with Arjuna. Arjuna praised Kṛṣṇa the soul of the universe etc as he had learned from Nārada etc saying that Śrī is always established in him and mentioning Duryodhana etc. . Arrived at Hāstinapura they entered the palace of Dhṛtarāṣṭra where they saw Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc. . Kṛṣṇa passed the night in the apartments of Arjuna. At morning they proceeded to Yudhiṣṭhira who sat with his ministers Yudhiṣṭhira mentioned Vasudeva etc and asked Kṛṣṇa to think of Yudhi ṣṭhira etc and to come back to his horse sacrifice. Kṛṣṇa took no gifts from him took leave of Kuntī Vidura etc and then set out from Hāstina pura with Subhadrā on the car accompanied by Arjuna Sātyaki etc.  then having caused them to return he with Dāruka and Sātyaki proceeded to the city of the Ānarttas . Arjuna repeatedly embraced Kṛṣṇa etc. . As he came to the desert he beheld Utaṅka  . Janamejaya said What did Kṛṣṇa next after having granted that boon to Utaṅka Vaiśampāyana said Having granted that boon to Utaṅka Kṛṣṇa accompanied by Sātyaki proceeded to Dvārakā on his car passing many lakes and rivers and forests and hills. He came there when the festival of Raivataka had begun the Raivataka hill shone with great splenr  gifts were ceaselessly being made to the distressed or blind or helpless. Kṛṣṇa re counted the incidents of the great battle to his father . Vasudeva said Tell me about the battle between the Pāṇḍavas and Bhīṣma etc. . Vaiśampāyana said Kṛṣṇa narrated also in the presence of his mother how the Kaurava heroes had been slain in battle. Kṛṣṇas narrative of the battle . Vaiśampāyana said The Vṛṣṇis became filled with grief . Kṛṣṇa had passed by the slaughter of Abhimanyu Subhadrā noticed it and fell n Vasudeva then also fell n and then asked Kṛṣṇa to tell the whole truth . Kṛṣṇa consoled him  . Vasudeva and Kṛṣṇa etc made excellent obsequial offerings to Abhimanyu and Kṛṣṇa fed six millions of brahmans and gave away heaps of gold etc. Also the Pāṇḍavas at Hāstinapura were filled with grief for Abhimanyu Uttarā totally abstained from all food and her relatives feared for her embryo Vyāsa came and predicted to Pṛthā Uttarā Arjuna and Yudhiṣṭhira that the son of Uttarā would become a great prince through the influence of Kṛṣṇa and Vyāsa Abhimanyu had gone to the regions of the gods. Arjuna became cheerful the child in Uttarās womb grew like the moon in the bright fortnight Vyāsa  urged Yudhiṣṭhira to perform the horse sacrifice and disappeared Yudhiṣṭhira set his mind on the journey for bringing wealth . Janamejaya said Having heard these words of Vyāsa what steps were taken by Yudhiṣṭhira how did he succeed in obtaining the wealth of Marutta Vaiśampāyana said Having heard the words of Vyāsa Yudhiṣṭhira summoned all his brothers reminding them of the words of Vyāsa Bhīṣma and Kṛṣṇa about Maruttas gold Bhīmasena was of his opinion saying that they must worship Śiva and his followers then the K.s who protected the treasures would certainly yield Yudhiṣṭhira was pleased the others headed by Arjuna approved. The Pāṇḍavas ordered their army to march under the nakṣatra Dhruva and on the day Dhruva and set out having worshipped Śiva with modakas frumenty and cakes of meat taking leave of Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc and keeping Yuyutsu in the capital . Then they set out  arrived at the spot they pitched their camp placing the brahmans and Āgniveśya  in the van then the Pāṇḍavas and the other kings and the brahmans and priests having performed propitiatory rites and placing the king and his ministers in the middle caused the camp to be pitched by laying out six roads and nine divisions king Yudhiṣṭhira caused a separate encampment to be made for the infuriated elephants the brahmans declared this very day to be an auspicious one on this day they would live upon water alone and they should all fast they passed the night on beds of kuśa grass listening to the discourses of the learned brahmans. When the cloudless morning came the brahmans told Yudhi ṣṭhira  to make offerings to Śiva. Dhaumya performed the rites and gave bali to the servants of Śiva offerings were next made to Kubera Maṇibhadra and to the other Y. and lords of Bh.  the king gave thousands of cows to the brahmans then he ordered bali for the night wandering Bh. Then the king placing Vyāsa ahead proceeded to the spot where the treasure was once more worshipping Kubera etc. . Numerous costly vessels were dug out and placed in wooden chests etc. there were camels horses and elephants etc. . Once more worshipping Śiva they set out for Hāstinapura with the permission of Vyāsa and placing Dhaumya in the van marched a goyuta  every day . Meanwhile Kṛṣṇa with Pradyumna etc came to see Draupadī etc and was received by Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc. . Uttarā gave birth to Parikṣit who was born without life afflicted with the Brāhma weapon Kuntī etc lamented and Kuntī asked Kṛṣṇa who came with Yuyudhāna to revive him and rescue Uttarā etc reminding him that Abhimanyu had said to Uttarā that her son would learn the art of weapons etc by the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas Kṛṣṇa comforted her . Then Subhadrā lamented  . Kṛṣṇa entered the lying in room  Uttarā lamented and so did Kuntī etc. Kṛṣṇa touched water and withdrew the Brāhma weapon and as Kaṃsa and Keśin have rightly been slain by me etc he revived the child . Parikṣit illumined the lying in room with his energy Rā. fled or were destroyed a voice in the sky applauded Kṛṣṇa the Brāhma weapon returned to Brahmán at the command of Kṛṣṇa the brahmans were made to utter benedictions  Kuntī etc were glad and praised Kṛṣṇa and so did wrestlers actors astrologers etc. Kṛṣṇa and the other Vṛṣṇi chiefs made precious gifts to the child whom Kṛṣṇa called Parikṣit . When he was a month old the Pāṇḍavas came back with the wealth and were received by those Vṛṣṇis and the citizens Vidura ordered various kinds of worship to be offered to the gods in their temples etc. with dancers and singers the city resembled the mansion of Kubera etc.  . Kṛṣṇa and his ministers went out to see the Pāṇḍavas who entered the city together with the Vṛṣṇis and worshipped Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc and also Kṛṣṇa having heard how he had revived Parikṣit after a few days Vyāsa came and was worshipped by the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas and he permitted Yudhiṣṭhira to perform the horse sacrifice a purifier of all sinners. Yudhi ṣṭhira asked Kṛṣṇa to perform the sacrifice but Kṛṣṇa told Yudhiṣṭhira to appoint them to whatever tasks he likes when thou sacrificest Bhīmasena etc will be sacri ficing . Yudhiṣṭhira asked Vyāsa to cause him to be initiated Vyāsa said that he and Paila and Yājñavalkya would perform the rites the initiation would be performed on the day of full moon in the month of Caitra let sūtas and brahmans well versed in the science of horses select a worthy horse all the articles were duly procured Vyāsa ordained that the sphya and the kūrca should be made of gold let the horse be loosened to day. Asked by Yudhi ṣṭhira Vyāsa ordained that Arjuna should protect the horse Bhīmasena the king aided by Nakula Sahadeva should attend to all the relatives invited  Yudhiṣṭhira asked Arjuna to spare all hostile kings as much as possible and to invite them to the horse sacrifice . Yudhiṣṭhira was initiated by the Ṛtvijs  the horse was let loose. Arjuna with Gāṇḍīva followed the horse all Hāstinapura came out wanting to behold him a disciple of Yājñavalkya followed him in order to perform auspicious rites for him and also many brahmans and kṣattriyas. During the horses wanderings many great and wonderful battles were fought the horse wandered over the whole earth from the north it turned to the east kings in myriads fought against Arjuna because they had lost their kinsmen on the field of Kurukṣetra and innumerable Kirātas Yavanas Mlecchas and Āryas  shall narrate only the principal battles . The Trigartas  attacked Arjuna who in vain asked them to forbear the Trigarta king Sūryavarman  Arjuna who slew Sūryavarmans younger brother Ketuvarman Dhṛtavarman  Arjuna who was wounded in his hand and let fall Gāṇḍīva but took it up again and slew eighteen warriors the Trigartas fled and accepted Arjunas inion . In Prāgjyotiṣa Bhagadattas son king Vajra datta  attacked Arjuna on his elephant but after a fierce battle  lasting three days he on the fourth day had his elephant slain and he promised to come to the horse sacrifice . Recollecting Jayadratha the Saindhavas mounted on cars attacked Arjuna who was on foot a terrible wind began to blow and Rāhu swallowed up both the sun and the moon at the same time etc. Kailāsa began to tremble the seven Ṛ. and the other Ṛ. of heaven breathed hot sighs Indras bow appeared in the sky and clouds poured flesh and blood on the earth Gāṇḍīva fell n the gods . ṛ Saptarṣis and B. ṛ. recited  victory to Arjuna who once more used his bow the Saindhavas fled but once more rallied Arjuna urged them to  surrender but in vain because they only thought of Jayadratha many were slain then Duḥśalā taking her grandson the son of Suratha in her arms repaired to Arjuna Arjuna dropped his bow and asked about Suratha she said that he had died from sorrow when he heard of Arjunas arrival she drew a parallel between Surathas  son and Abhimanyus  son Parikṣit. Recollecting Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī and censuring kṣattriya practices and Duryodhana Arjuna consoled and embraced her Duḥśalā asked her warriors to desist and returned home. At last the horse arrived at Maṇipūra where Babhruvāhana Arjunas son by Citrāṅ gadā humbly approached Arjuna together with a number of brahmans bringing treasure in his van Arjuna angrily blamed him for having neglected his duty as a kṣattriya. Ulūpī came from within the earth and beheld her son standing cheerless and incited him to fight Arjuna which he did  he even caused the sacrificial horse to be seized gravely wounded Arjuna praised his son highly he cut off his standard which was set with gold and resembled a golden palmyra and then he slew his steeds at last Arjuna fell n in a swoon and so did Babhruvāhana Citrāṅgadā repaired to the battlefield weeping piteously  she indulged in copious lamentations lost her senses and fell n on the earth regaining consciousness and seeing Ulūpī she blamed her for having brought about Arjunas slaughter by Babhruvāhana and asked her to revive him  not grieve for my slain son only grieve for my husband otherwise she would sit in prāya and die the horse she had set free. Regaining consciousness Babhruvāhana lamented piteously saying that now he had slain his father he would wander over the earth covering himself with his fathers skin or with the two halves of his head as an expiation or else he would die he took an oath  that if Arjuna was not revived he would emaciate his own body sitting on the field of battle  shall without bt have to sink into hell he who has slain a heroic kṣattriya becomes purified by making a gift of cows who have slain my father cannot be rescued. Ulūpī thought of the gem that has the virtue of reviving a dead man the gem thus thought of came there she said that Arjuna had not been vanquished by Babhruvāhana but Ulūpī had exhibited this illusion for the benefit of Arjuna. As soon as the prince had placed the gem on the breast of Arjuna the latter revived. Indra poured n celestial flowers etc. Arjuna wondered why the two ladies were present and why every thing seemed to indicate grief and asked Babhruvāhana who told him to question Ulūpī . Asked by Arjuna Ulūpī recited the curse of the Vasus  because Arjuna had slain Bhīṣma in unfair fight  if Arjuna had died without having expiated his sin he would have fallen into Hell hearing the curse of the Vasus Ulūpī had consulted her father who prevailed upon the Vasus that Arjuna should be freed from their curses when he had been slain by Babhruvāhana. Arjuna highly approved of Ulūpīs action and told Babhruvāhana to come with his mother and counsellors and officers to the horse sacrifice Babhruvāhana promised to come and to take upon himself the task of distributing food among the brahmans . He asked Arjuna to pass the night in the city with his two wives but Arjuna was prevented by his vow of following the horse he took leave and proceeded  on his way . The horse having wandered over the whole earth turned its face towards Hāstinapura. At Rājagṛha the Magadha king Meghasandhi son of Sahadeva attacked Arjuna who was on foot from his chariot Meghasandhi was worsted but spared and told to come to the horse sacrifice. The horse then proceeded along the sea coast through the country of the Vaṅgas Puṇḍras and Kośalas in these countries Arjuna vanquished innumerable Mleccha armies . Arjuna proceeded towards the south. The horse came to Cuktimatī the beautiful city of the Cedis. Śarabha the son of Śiśupāla fought Arjuna and then worshipped him. Then the horse came to the Kāśis Aṅgas Kośalas Kirātas and Taṅgaṇas then to the Daśārṇas whose ruler Citrāṅgada was vanquished by Arjuna then to the inions of the Niṣāda king the son of Ekalavya who was vanquished after a furious battle then towards the southern ocean where the Draviḍas Andhras Māhiṣakas and Kolvagireyas  were subjugated then to the Surāṣṭras Gokarṇa Prabhāsa and Dvāravatī where the Yādava youths were going to beat the horse but were forbidden by King Ugrasena who came to Arjuna with Vasudeva. Then the horse proceeded along the coast of the western ocean to the prosperous country of the five rivers then to the Gāndhāras where a fierce battle ensued with the Gāndhāra king the son of Śakuni who wanted to avenge the slaughter of Śakuni many Gāndhāras were slain at last the king disregarding Arjunas peaceful advice fought alone Arjuna shot off his headgear then he and all the Gāndhāras fled the mother of the king and all the aged ministers came out and forbade her son to fight Arjuna said he had spared him for the sake of Gāndhārī and Dhṛtarāṣṭra and told him to come to the horse sacrifice . The horse then turned towards the road that led to Hāstinapura. As these tidings reached the Kuru court through the intelli gence bearers Yudhiṣṭhira rejoiced and on the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of Māgha under a favourable con stellation he summoned his brothers and caused Bhīma to let learned brahmans select a beautiful spot for the sacri ficial compound . Then Bhīma sent messengers to invite the kings of the earth they brought gems female slaves horses and weapons. All the foremost brahmans also came there with their disciples likewise many dialecticians disputing with each other. All was made of gold. One hundred thousand brahmans were fed many mountains of food many large tanks of curds and many lakes of ghee were seen there. The entire population of Jambudvīpa was collected together . Yudhiṣṭhira appointed Bhīmasena to pay proper honours to the royal guests and to their attendants. Kṛṣṇa came with the Vṛṣṇis Baladeva etc.  Kṛṣṇa told Yudhiṣṭhira about Arjuna that he had become very much emaciated and that he was near at hand he had warned against a carnage similar to that at the presenting of the Arghya and he had especially recommended Babhruvāhana . Yudhiṣṭhira enquired of Kṛṣṇa why Arjuna had to suffer such hardships in life Kṛṣṇa attributes it to the elevation of Arjunas cheek bones Draupadī looked angrily at Kṛṣṇa who approved of her love. Bhīmasena etc became gratified with Arjunas triumphs. A messenger announced the arrival of Arjuna and was presented with large gifts. On the second day Arjuna entered the city  people said that he had surpassed even Sagara etc. Arjuna saluted Yudhiṣṭhira etc. . Babhruvāhana  came with his mother and entered the abode of Kuntī  Citrāṅgadā  saluted Pṛthā etc.  Babhruvāhana saluted Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc.  Kṛṣṇa gave him an excellent chariot and steeds and the others likewise gave him presents. On the third day Vyāsa told Yudhiṣṭhira to commence the sacrifice and to make the dakṣiṇā threefold. Yudhiṣṭhira underwent the dīkṣā. The sacrifice was duly performed  animals were tied to the stakes in addition to the horse this sacrifice was honoured by the presence of . ṛ G Aps Kp and Ku. there were the disciples of Vyāsa etc.   having cooked the other animals the priests sacrificed the horse after having cut it into pieces they caused Draupadī to sit near it then the brahmans cooked its marrow Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers smelled the sin destroying smoke of that marrow the limbs  the sixteen ṛtvijs offered into the fire. Vyāsa and his disciples eulogised Yudhiṣṭhira who gave crores of golden niṣkas to the brahmans and the whole earth as dakṣiṇā to Vyāsa Vyāsa returned it to him telling him to give the purchasing value instead Yudhiṣ ṭhira said that the dakṣiṇā for the horse sacrifice is the earth and that he would enter the woods and tell them to divide it into four parts one for each of the four principal priests  his brothers and Draupadī approved of his words as did also a voice in the sky Vyāsa and Kṛṣṇa prevailed upon him to retain the earth and give away millions of golden coins trebling the dakṣiṇā for the horse sacrifice no other king would be able to accomplish what Yudhiṣṭhira thus did after the manner of Marutta Vyāsa gave the wealth  to the officiating priests in four parts and they distributed it among the brahmans who were also permitted to take the ornaments of gold etc. the remaining wealth was allotted to kṣattriyas Vaiśyas Śūdras and Mlecchas. Vyāsa gave away his own share to Kuntī who devoted it to various meritorious acts. Yudhiṣṭhira performed the final sacrificial bath and dismissed the kings etc with proper honours and gifts. There were oceans of wine of different kinds etc.  people of different realms speak of this sacrifice to this day. Then Yudhiṣṭhira entered his capital . Janamejaya said Tell me of any wonderful incident that occurred in the sacrifice of my grandfather. Vaiśampāyana related how a mongoose disparaged the sacrifice Nakulākhyāna  then the mongoose dis appeared and the brahmans returned home. Thou shouldst not think highly of sacrifice millions of Ṛ. have ascended to Heaven with the sole aid of their penances abstention from injury contentment proper conduct sincerity penances self restraint truthfulness and gifts are each equal in point of merit to sacrifice . Seeing that kings are given to sacrifice M. ṛ. to penance and learned brahmans to tranquillity etc Janamejaya cannot but think that nothing can be compared with the result of sacrifices since Indra obtained the sovereignty over the gods by his many sacrifices and when Yudhiṣṭhira Bhīma and Arjuna resembled Indra why did then that mongoose depreciate Yudhiṣṭhiras horse sacrifice Vaiśampāyana said Formerly when Indra was performing a sacrifice the Ṛ. felt compassion on the animals and said to Indra that the slaughter of animals in sacrifices had not been ordained according to the  scriptural ordinances the sacrifice should be performed with  seeds of grain which had been kept for three years. As Indra did not accept their words a great dispute arose they referred to the Cedi king Vasu who declared that a sacrifice may be performed with whichever of the two kinds of objects is ready he therefore had to enter Rasātala therefore no one should singly be relied upon when a bt arises except Brahmán gifts made by a sinful person and with wealth acquired by unrighteous means became lost while men possessing the wealth of penances acquired great merit and proceeded to Heaven by giving away to the best of their ability grains of corn or roots etc or water or leaves. The same results are also won by compassion brahmacarya truthfulness kindness fortitude and forgiveness which are the eternal foundations of eternal righteousness having made gifts of articles lawfully acquired Viśvāmitra etc have attained to high success those amongst brahmans kṣattriyas vaiśyas and Śūdras who betake themselves to penances and who purify themselves by gifts and other acts of righteousness proceed to Heaven . Janamejaya said If Heaven is the result of wealth acquired by lawful means please tell me all about it thou hast told me the great result that accrued to the brahman living by gleaning grains from his gift of powdered barley. Vaiśampāyana cited the old narrative of what occurred in former days at the great sacrifice of Agastya . Asked by Janamejaya Vaiśampāyana explained that the mongoose  with a golden head was Dharma who had been cursed by P but freed from his curse by disparaging himself in the form of Yudhiṣṭhira the mongoose dis appeared there in our very sight .

Janamejaya,son of,Parikṣit,the first of the minor parvans . The Sūta Ugraśravas son of Lomaharṣaṇa had heard the Mahābhārata which had been composed by Vyāsa recited under the direction of Dvai pāyana  himself by Vaiśampāyana disciple of Vyāsa at the serpent sacrifice of king Janamejaya son of Parikṣit he had thereupon undertaken a pilgrimage to the tīrthas  and visited Samantapañcaka  thence he came to the twelve years sattra  of  Śaunaka in the Naimiṣa forest where he related the Mahābhārata beginning with the aation of Viṣṇu identified with the Absolute and  a brief exposition of the creation and succession of beings from the Absolute through Brahmán the Prajāpatis gods etc n to the families of the Kurus etc mentioned in the poem. The Mahābhārata contains an enlarged and an abridged form some make it begin with Manu some with Āstīka and some with Uparicara  . Vyāsa had composed the Mahābhārata in a moment and at the counsel of Brahmán had Gaṇeśa to write it n as fast as he dictated to him.  The portion destined for men  he taught Vaiśampāyana who narrated it in the intervals between the parts of the serpent sacrifice of Janamejaya first giving a survey of the principal contents partly in the form of a conversation between Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sañjaya. Sañjaya in order to console Dhṛtarāṣṭra first enumerated great kings who were formerly mentioned by Nārada to Śaivya  when lamenting the loss of a son and thereupon  others who had all died. He who hears or reads the Mahābhārata is purified from the most atrocious sins .

Karṇa1,son of,Sūrya,Karṇa1 son of Sūrya with Kuntī ated by the Sūta Adhi ratha and his wife Rādhā and the counsellor of Duryodhana     . b K. was born of Kuntī and Sūrya with his armour and ear rings . b  When Kuntī had thrown her child into the water it was taken up by the husband of Rādhā and called Vasuṣeṇa. He grew very strong and soon mastered the vedāṅgas there was nothing he would not give to the brahmans. In order to benefit Arjuna Indra in the guise of a brahman obtained his ear rings and armour and in return gave him a lance with which he could slay any one amongst gods Asuras men Gandharvas and Rākṣasas. Because he took off  his natural armour and ear rings he was called Vaikartana Karṇa. He was the friend and counsellor of Duryodhana .  c  When the exhibition had nearly ended there was heard proceeding from the gate the slapping of arms like to the roar of thunder. Then K.  proceeded with his natural mail and ear ring and bowed to Droṇa and Kṛpa. Having spoken disdainfully to Arjuna at which Duryodhana was filled with delight he then with the permission of Droṇa did all that Arjuna had e before. Duryodhana and his brothers in joy embraced K. K. asked for a single combat with Arjuna who rebuked him. Droṇa gave his consent to the encounter. Indra covered Arjuna with clouds while the Sun dispersed the clouds from K who remained visible surrounded by the rays of the Sun. When Kṛpa asked K. to tell his lineage  K. was ashamed but Duryodhana  immediately installed K. king of the Aṅgas . Then Adhiratha entered the lists and embraced K. as his son Bhīmasena seeing this scoffed at K. as the son of a charioteer but was reprimanded by Duryodhana  that was made from the bones of Dadhīca Guha i.e. Skanda is named the son of Agni or of the Kṛttikāḥ or of Rudra or of Gaṅgā Viśvāmitra and other kṣatriyas who became brahmans Droṇa and Kṛpa. When the sun went n Duryodhana led K. out of the arena. Kuntī had recognized K. as her son and was pleased at his success. Duryodhana banished his fear of Arjuna when he had obtained Karṇas friendship which could only slay one person so that Arjuna might be saved           with natural ear rings and armour by whom Jarā sandha was vanquished and mangled  in a wrestling encounter              . c hatasya Narakasyātmā Kmūrtim upāśritaḥ .  Asked by Jana mejaya Vaiśampāyana related the secret which was not revealed to K. by Sūrya. Pṛthā the sister of Vasudeva and the daughter of the Vṛṣṇi Śūra and ated by King Kuntibhoja was ordered by Kuntibhoja to wait upon a brahman of fierce energy . After a year the brahman gave her a mantra by which she might invoke the gods . When she at the time of her seasons saw the suns orbit she became possessed of celestial power of vision and beheld Sūrya with his coat of mail and his ear rings and invoked him. By way of yoga he divided himself into two one of whom appeared before Kuntī. At first Kuntī was frightened but Sūrya reassured her saying Thou shalt remain a virgin  after having gratified me and thy son shall have the ear rings and the coat of mail made of amṛta that have been given to me by Aditi etc. then he entered her by virtue of yoga . This happened in the bright fortnight of the tenth month . Except her nurse nobody else knew about the matter when the child was born she consulted with her nurse and placed it in a box on the river Aśvanadī imploring protection from Varuṇa Sūrya A  R S .  M diśaḥ digīśvarāḥ etc. from Aśvanadī the basket floated to the river Carmaṇvatī thence to the Yamunā and so on to the Gaṅgā to the town of Campā in the country of the Aṅgas ruled by the sūta Adhiratha who was childless. They ated the child and called him Vasuṣeṇa and Vṛṣa . After having ated K Adhiratha had other sons begotten by himself. When K. had grown up he was sent to Hāstinapura and acquired the four kinds of weapons from Droṇa Kṛpa and Rāma and became the friend of Duryodhana but was intent on injuring the Pāṇḍavas especially Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira was afraid of him. When K. after rising from the water at noon worshipped Sūrya brahmans used to solicit him for wealth and there was nothing that he would not give away to the brahmans . Indra in the guise of a brahman appeared before him asked him for his coat of mail and gave him instead a dart which could not be baffled and which in the hands of Indra destroyed the Daityas and then returned to him. This dart can only slay one powerful enemy of thine and then it will return to me but it will not be that one which thou seekest to slay for he is protected by Kṛṣṇa. K. cut the coat of mail and ear rings off his person Indra having granted him that his body thus disfigured should not become unsightly. Gods and men and Dānavas raised a leonine roar. For this feat he was called Karṇa. The Dhārtarāṣṭras became distressed and the Pāṇḍavas were filled with joy. Having rescued Kṛṣṇā from Jayadratha and listened to the ancient stories recited by Mārkaṇḍeya the Pāṇḍavas returned from Kāmyaka to Dvaitavana . b .          ʹ ʹ bis who gave him the town Mālinī  K the king of the Aṅgas then ruled in Campā agreeably to the wishes of Duryodhana .

The sceptic argues the deities G and Dā. have become what they are in consequence of their own nature . Continuation . Rantideva obtained success in all the worlds by worshipping the ascetics with offerings of only roots and fruits and leaves.

Various kinds of kṣatriyas etc have sprung from the four original orders by intermixture. Janaka asked how those born in pure wombs and those in impure ones all became brahmans.  Parāśara said that it was by cleansing their souls by penances instancing Vasiṣṭha etc. .

At the end of Brahmáns night Śambhu of formless soul etc awakes and once more creates that first or eldest of all creatures the eldest born being is called Hiraṇyagarbha = Buddhi = Mahat  = Viriñci = the unborn in the Sāṅkhya scriptures  he has many names... the creations of knowledge and of ignorance bodies are possessed by all bodiless creatures etc. ...transcending the twenty four topics already adverted to is the twenty fifth called Viṣṇu. There are three colours in all white red and dark . Continuation . Do. . Do. That which the Yogins behold is precisely that to which the Sāṅkhyas strive to attain .  Continuation .

Yogins have great regard for the Sāṅkhya system as also for the Vedas in the Sāṅkhya system no principle transcending the twenty fifth is admitted in the Yoga it is said that Bráhman... becomes the personal soul  only when invested with ignorance in the Yoga scriptures therefore both Bráhman and jīva are spoken of  . Vasiṣṭhas discourse on buddha and abuddha.  had acquired this knowledge from the eternal Hiraṇyagarbha himself who communicated it to me for my having carefully gratified that great Being of very superior Soul... it has been imparted to thee exactly as had it from Brahmán himself. Bhīṣma said This knowledge was obtained by Vasiṣṭha from Hiraṇyagarbha from Vasiṣṭha it was handed over to Nārada and from this to me . Bhīṣma recited the conversation between king Vasumat son of Janaka and a brahman and Ṛ. of Bhṛgus race whom Vasumat saw in the forests when in pursuit of deer and by whom he was instructed. R. ṛ.

King Vasumat withdrawing his mind from the pursuit of desire set it upon the acquisition of righteousness . Asked by Yudhiṣṭhira Bhīṣma discoursed on that which is freed from duty and its reverse by reciting the old narrative of the discourse between Ṛ. Yājñavalkya and king Daivarāti Janaka who got instruction from Yājñavalkya. The nine kinds of creation . Yājñavalkyas discourse on the creation of the universe kalpas are said to constitute a single day of the unmanifest one the duration of his night is equal when his night expires he awakes and first creates herbs and plants he then creates Brahmán or Prajāpati who springs from a golden egg.. kalpas measure the day of Brahmán and his night is of equal duration Brahmán  then creates Ahaṅkāra etc. . Yājñavalkyas discourse on the destruction of the universe Brahmán who is eternal and undecaying and who is without beginning and without end repeatedly creates and destroys all created objects when his day expires and night comes he becomes desirous of sleep at such a time the unmanifest and holy one urges the Being called Mahā Rudra who assumes the form of Sūrya and divides himself into twelve portions etc. ...Consciousness  in his turn is swallowed up by the Great Soul who  is again swallowed up by Śambhu Prajāpati Aṇiman etc. ... .

The story of Yājñavalkyas acquisition of the Yajurveda as a boon from Sūrya who had been gratified with his penances Sūrya had said Made up of the essence of speech the goddess Sarasvatī will enter into thy body he then commanded me to open my mouth Sarasvatī then entered into my body and began to burn and plunged into a stream angry with Sūrya who told me that the burning would soon cease and then the whole Veda with its appendix and the Upaniṣads would appear in me by inward light and should edit the entire Śatapatha and then turn to the path of emancipation coveted both by Sāṅkhyas and by Yogins. Sūrya then went to the Asta hills. Sarasvatī appeared before me . taught the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa etc to good disciples and thereby did what was disagreeable to my maternal uncle . undertook the management of the sacrifice of thy father there a dispute arose between me and my maternal uncle as to who should be permitted to appropriate the dakṣiṇā for the recitation of the Vedas in the very presence of Devala took half of that dakṣiṇā thy father and Sumantu and Paila and Jaimini etc all acquiesced in that arrangement. had thus got from Sūrya the fifteen Yajuṣes and likewise Romaharṣa learned the Purāṇas . Aided by Sarasvatī and Sūrya then set myself to compile the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa... G. Viśvāvasu conversant with the Vedānta once put me twenty four questions relating to the Vedas and then a twenty fifth   having thought of Sarasvatī answered them properly having expounded to him the fourth science that treats of emancipation and which is based upon the twenty fifth principle i.e. jīva.  The personal soul  and the Supreme Soul should be regarded as one and the same. This Viśvāvasu thought difficult to understand quoting Jaigīṣavya etc.  M. ṛ. in Brahmaloka say that Āditya  himself is thy preceptor. Yājñavalkya instructed him of the relation of the twenty fifth  to the twenty sixth . Viśvāvasu proceeded towards heaven and inculcated the science he had obtained from me to the gods in Brahmaloka etc. Honoured by Daivarāti Yājñavalkya left his court the king gave a million of kine etc to a number of brahmans installing his son in the sovereignty of the Videhas he ated the practices of the Yatis and began to study the science of the Sāṅkhyas and Yogins. They who wait upon Mahat attain to the regions of Mahat they who wait upon Consciousness attain to the spot that belongs to Consciousness etc.   got all this knowledge from Janaka who had obtained it from Yājñavalkya . Yudhiṣṭhira asked how one may avoid decrepitude and death. Bhīṣma related the old narrative of the Bhikṣu M. ṛ.

Asked by Yudhiṣṭhira as to how it is possible for a householder to attain to emancipation Bhīṣma recited the Sulabhā Janakasaṃvāda  . Yudhiṣṭhira inquired how in days of old Śuka Vaiyāsaki was won over to renunciation . Bhīṣma recited the discourse of Vyāsa to Śuka expounding the vanity of worldly attachments. That sinful wretch who transgresses the ten boundaries that have been fixed by Svayambhū himself is obliged to pass his time in great affliction in the wild wastes in the inions of the king of the Pitṛs that man who is tainted with cupidity...  has to go to deep hells...and is forced to bathe in the broad river Vaitaraṇī whose waters are scalding etc. ...Very soon the wind of Yama will blow before thee...By performing the duties of the estic life men attain to the region of Prajāpati or Bṛhaspati or Indra.

Pāṇḍu,son of,Vyāsa,Pāṇḍu son of Vyāsa by Ambālikā the wi of Vicitravīrya husband of Kuntī and Mādrī and father of the five Pāṇḍavas            .  P. then at the command of Dhṛtarāṣṭra offered his wealth to Bhīṣma Satyavatī Kausalyā Vidura etc and with the wealth acquired by him Dhṛtarāṣṭra performed horse sacrifices. With Kuntī and Mādrī he became a permanent inhabitant of the woods addicted to hunting on the southern slope of the Himālaya supplied with every object of pleasure and enjoyment at the command of Dhṛtarāṣṭra .  The muni Kindama inflicted a curse on P cf. Agastya . P. declared that he would lead the life of a brahmacārin according to the āraṇyaśāstras and send his attendants to Hāstinapura to inform Bhīṣma etc and with his wives protected by mahābhūtas Siddhas and paramarṣis he traversed the mountain of Nāgaśata Caitraratha Kālakūṭa Himavat Gandhamādana Indradyumnasaras and Haṃsakūṭa then he practised ascetic austerities on Śataśṛṅga . P. became dear to the Siddhas Cāraṇas and ṛṣis and like to a brahmarṣi. On the new moon day when the maharṣis assembled in order to partake of a great gathering of gods ṛṣis and pitṛs in the abode of Brahmán P. wanted to accompany them with his wives from Śataśṛṅga to the north but they told him that the princesses could not ascend the king of mountains where they had seen the retreats of gods Gandharvas and Apsarases and the gardens of Kubera where only Vāyu and the Siddhas and the para marṣis could go. As he complained of being childless they told him to let somebody else raise offspring for him. P.s conversation with Kuntī. P. quoted the words of Manu Svāyambhuva  and the example of Śāradaṇḍāyanī . Kuntī in reply alleged the Paurāṇic narrative of  Vyuṣitāśva  and entreated Pāṇḍu to beget children by his ascetic power . P. said that women formerly were not bound to adhere faithfully to their husband and were not regarded sinful when yielding to their desire that practice was applauded by the maharṣis and even now prevailed among birds and beasts and among the Uttara Kurus. It was the muni Śvetaketu  who established the now existing practice . P. further alleged the example of Madayantī  and of Vyāsa . Kuntī related to Pāṇḍu how she had obtained the mantra from Durvāsas  P. told her to invoke Dharma .  P. died in accordance with the curse inflicted on him by Kindama . Kuntī wished to be burnt together with him but this Mādrī did not allow and herself ascended the funeral pyre . The ascetics took Kuntī the children and the two corpses to Hāstinapura. Hearing of the arrival of thousands of Cāraṇas  and munis people soon after sunrise began to come out from the city to see together with Bhīṣma Somadatta Bāhlika the blind rājarṣi the kṣattṛ Vidura Satyavatī Kausalyā Gāndhārī accompanied by the other ladies of the royal household and the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. It was seventeen days after the death of P. . The ṛṣis etc suddenly disappeared like a fata morgana .

Parīkṣit,son of,Abhimanyu,Parikṣit or Parīkṣit son of Abhimanyu and Uttarā and father of Janamejaya .  One day king P the son of Abhimanyu when hunting having pierced a deer lost sight of it. He then asked the muni Śamīka but received no answer as the muni was then observing the vow of silence in anger the king then placed upon the munis shoulder a dead snake and returned to his capital Hāstinapura. Of this the munis son Śṛṅgin was informed in a quarrel by his companion Kṛśa and then cursed P saying that within seven nights he should be stung to death by Takṣaka. The muni was not pleased with the curse as P. properly protected his subjects . Therefore he sent his disciple Gauramukha to inform P who became very repentant and sorrowful. A mansion was erected upon a solitary column and well guarded. The seventh day the brahman Kāśyapa was coming desirous of curing the king. Takṣaka in the shape of an old brahman met with Kāśyapa . As Kāśyapa revived a banyan which had been reduced to ashes by being bitten by Takṣaka Takṣaka gave to Kāśyapa more wealth than what he expected from P and having ascertained by means of yoga that P.s span of life was at an end Kāśyapa retired. Takṣaka went to Hāstinapura and hearing that P. was protected by poison neutralizing mantras and medicines he caused some serpents in the guise of ascetics to present the king with kuśa grass water and fruits in one of which he himself was concealed as a tiny ugly insect. As such he appeared when P. was eating the fruit. P. said The sun is setting to day have no more fear from poison therefore let this insect becoming Takṣaka bite me so that  the words of the ascetic may be rendered true. Then he placed the insect on his neck and was bitten by Takṣaka who coiled round his neck and uttered a tremens roar . The ministers of Janamejaya told him about P that he was virtuous a pupil of Śāradvata  in the science of arms and dear to Govinda and that he had got his name because he was born by Uttarā parikṣīṇeṣu Kuruṣu and that he ruled sixty years that being addicted to hunting he made over all affairs of state to his ministers then how he insulted Śamīka and his death  they also mentioned that Takṣaka had insulted the ṛṣi Uttaṅka .

brahman,son of,an,and   .  Questioned by Yudhiṣṭhira about the virtue of women Mārkaṇḍeya saying that the work of a mother is more difficult than that of a father and that for women neither sacrifices nor śrāddhas nor fasts are of any efficacy but that they can win heaven only by serving their husbands related When the brahman Kauśika who had studied the Vedas and the Upaniṣads was reciting the Vedas under a tree a female crane befouled his body and looked upon with anger by Kauśika fell to the ground. Kauśika regretted his angry deed. When he had entered a village in order to procure alms in a certain house the wife first served her husband who came home tired and hungry with food etc and then began to conciliate the angry Kauśika who blamed her for exalting her husband above the brahmans. She said that she was no she crane that she knew that the ocean had been made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the brahmans that the fire of their wrath had not to this day been extinguished in the forest of Daṇḍaka but that she regarded her husband as her supreme god and deserved forgiveness that anger is a foe to men within themselves and that the gods know him to be a brahman who has abaned anger and passion etc. and who though himself injured never returns the injury etc that virtue  is difficult to understand but must be based on truth the ancients have declared that virtue depends on śruti but it is variously defined  and subtle to be understood  thou art cognisant of virtue and studiest the Vedas but think however that thou t not know what virtue really is a fowler  in Mithilā will discourse to thee on virtue. Kauśika blessed her and returned to his abode reproaching himself . He set out for Mithilā ruled over by Janaka and found out the fowler who was seated in a butchers yard selling venison and buffalo meat to a large crowd of buyers but he at once went to Kauśika and proving that he knew why he had come he led him to his abode where he honoured him duly and explained to him that notwithstanding his cruel trade which he had inherited from his sires and grandsires and which belonged to his caste by birth he led a virtuous life serving his superiors and old people speaking truth never  envying others giving to the best of his power etc. In the king of Janaka there did not exist a single subject that did not follow the duties of his caste. He did not slay the boars and buffaloes himself nor did he eat meat himself he fasted during the day and ate in the night even though the behaviour of his order be bad a person may yet be himself of good behaviour so also a person may become virtuous although he may by profession be a slayer of animals. It is the fault of the kings when the subjects decay and monsters dwarfs etc are produced but Janaka ruled justly. If one repents a wrong e by him he is delivered from his sin . If a man seeks redemption  after having committed a sin he becomes purified of all his sins . It is temptation  that constitutes the basis of sin. Then he gave some advice as to what is virtuous conduct  of the virtuous a man must not wrong to anybody he must give alms and must always be truthful  of the virtuous . The fowler and the animals slain by him are driven by their karman in a former life. In days of yore animals and cows used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva at the cāturmāsya animals are sacrificed the śruti says The fires are fond of meat and at the sacrifices animals are killed by the regenerate and these animals are purged of sin and by mantras go to heaven. Regarding animal food this rule has been laid n by munis Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully  to the gods and the Pitṛs is not polluted by the act. The śruti says Such a man is not one who partakes of animal food and a brahman who has intercourse with his wife during her season is a brahma cārin. King Saudāsa under the influence of a curse ate human flesh. Agriculture is considered to be praiseworthy though the plough destroys many creatures. Seeds of rice etc are all living creatures. As to hunting and the cutting of trees and herbs many creatures live in trees and fruits and water. The earth and the air are all swarming with living organisms which are unconsciously destroyed by men from mere ignorance . When life is at stake and in the matter of marriage it is justified to tell an untruth. Whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is considered to be truth  . The fowler discoursed upon the influence of karman upon metempsychosis and salvation  . Questioned by Kauśika about the senses the fowler discoursed about the sinful  the evolution of sin is this First manas is bent on vijñāna thence successively originate kāma roṣa karman rāga dveṣa lobha moha vyāja adharma pāpa. The virtuous man discerns these evils by means of his spiritual insight . Then he shortly enumerated the elements of the brāhmī vidyā  twenty four   . A somewhat more detailed explanation of the five elements and their qualities. The terms vyakta and avyakta . Salvation etc are dependent on self discipline that is impossible without subduing the senses. The body is like a chariot the coachman being the soul and the horses the six senses . The three qualities sattva rajas and tamas . The five vital airs that are all seated  in the navel and by whose collision the internal fire is generated that digests the food. The arteries issuing from the heart in all directions carry the essence of food  acted upon by the ten prāṇas. The perception of the internal spirit purification of the heart destroys the good and evil effects of actions and leads to eternal beatitude. That state of peace and purification of heart  is likened to the state of a person who in a cheerful state of mind  sleeps soundly or to a lamp shining on a windless spot well kindled. Community with Bráhman cannot be taught to us even by the guru  . Saying Thou shalt see by what means have attained to this blissful state the fowler introduced Kauśika to his parents whom he honoured together with his wife and children like gods  . The fowler said Thou hast wronged thy father and thy mother for thou hast left home without their permission for the purpose of learning the Vedas and they have become blind from grief at thy loss. Thereby thy ascetic merit etc have become useless to thee. Do return home this very day. Kauśika acknowledged that the fowler had rescued him when he was on the point of falling into hell and that he did not consider him to be a śūdra as it was very difficult for a śūdra to learn the eternal religion  his being a śūdra must surely be due to any action in a former birth this Kauśika wished to learn. The fowler told  was formerly a brahman son of an eminent brahman and versed in the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas and friend of a king who was accomplished in the Dhanurveda and thence skilled in archery myself one day when accompanied the king on a hunting expedition killed a ṛṣi whom took for a deer and was cursed by him to be born as a fowler in the śūdra caste  but prevailed upon him to grant me that should remain a pious man and honour my parents and thereby attain great perfection remember my past life and again become a brahman. took the ṛṣi to the hermitage and he did not die. Kauśika saluted him respectfully and having returned home he honoured his old parents .

muni,son of,Vibhāṇḍaka,Ṛṣyaśṛṅga a muni son of Vibhāṇḍaka  . d  Ṛ the son of Kāśyapa  born by a hind caused Indra to rain during a drought in the territory of Lomapāda who gave him his daughter Śāntā . . The viprarṣi Vibhāṇḍaka Kāśyapa practising austerities near a great lake saw the Apsaras Urvaśī whence his semen fell into the water and was lapped up by a hind that was drinking. That hind was a daughter of the gods . Brahmán had transformed her into a hind and when she had given birth to a muni she would be freed. She now gave birth to a son who was named Ṛṣyaśṛṅga because there was a horn on his head. He passed his days in the forest devoted to brahmacarya and he had never seen any human being except his father. At that time the king of the Aṅgas Lomāpāda a friend of Daśaratha had been shunned by the brahmans and was without a purohita because he had been  guilty of falsehood towards a brahman and therefore Indra did not give rain in his territory. At the advice of a wise brahman he did atonement for his sins and appeased the brahmans. Thereafter he assembled his ministers in order to discuss means for bringing Ṛ. to his land. According to their counsel a courtezan with a number of women etc was sent to Ṛ. . She had constructed a floating hermitage which she moored at a short distance from Vibhāṇ ḍakas hermitage and then sent her daughter a courtezan to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. She refused the fruits foot washing etc saying that her religious vows consisted in not receiving such things but implied that she might embrace him. By giving him unsuitable food garlands beautiful garments and drinks and by playing and clasping him in her arms she made him overpowered with love and as she went away under the pretext of performing the agnihotra he became sad. When Vibhāṇḍaka  returned he wondered that Ṛ. was not splitting the logs for fuel etc and asked who had been there . Ṛ. said that a religious student  had come to him he had a mass of hair  and a pair of ornaments upon his wrist like his rosary  his matted hair  was neatly tied up and adhered to the forehead and was divided in two etc. He  wished to go to him and see him every day . Vibhāṇḍaka declared that it was a Rākṣasa and in vain spent three days in searching for this one. When Vibhāṇḍaka had gone out to collect fruits the courtezans allured Ṛ. to enter the bark which they unmoored and in this way they brought him to Lomapāda who prepared a beautiful forest named Nāvyāśrama  and kept Ṛ. in the female apartments. Suddenly rain poured n. Lomapāda gave his daughter Śāntā to Ṛ. When Vibhāṇḍaka was going to Campā in order to burn the king the city and his whole territory the king let kine be placed and fields ploughed along the road and ordered the cowherds to honour Vibhāṇ ḍaka with hospitality when he was fatigued and hungry and to say that all this belonged to his son and that they were his slaves. Thus Vibhāṇḍaka was appeased. According to the command of his father Ṛ as soon as a son had been born to him returned to his father in the wood and Śāntā followed and obeyed him as Indrasenā Nārāyaṇī was ever obedient to Mudgala etc    .

Gādhi,son of,Kuśika,Vāsiṣṭha  . . Arjuna wished to hear about Vasiṣṭha. The Gandharva said Vasiṣṭha is Brahmáns spiritual son and Arundhatīs husband Kāma and Krodha who cannot be vanquished even by the immortals used to shampoo his feet. Though his wrath was excited by Viśvāmitras offence he did not yet exterminate the Kuśikas. Afflicted at the loss of his sons he did not any dreadful deed for the destruction of Viśvāmitra. He did not transgress Kṛtānta  in order to bring back his lost children from the abode of Yama. It was by obtaining him that the Ikṣvākus acquired this earth and with him as their purohita they performed many great sacrifices. Therefore acquire a fit purohita . Arjuna wished to hear of the hostility between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha. The Gandharva said This old  story of Vasiṣṭha they tell in all worlds. In Kānyakubja king Gādhi son of Kuśika had a son Viśvāmitra who with his ministers used to go a hunting. Once he arrived at the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha who offered him arghya etc. from his cow Nandinī who yielded everything desired Viśvāmitra asked Vasiṣṭha to give him Nandinī for an arbuda of kine or his king but in vain. Then he wanted to take the cow by force. She repaired to Vasiṣṭha who at first did nothing saying am a forgiving brahman but at last he said  not aban you Stay if you can Hearing this word the cow attacked Viśvāmitras troops from her tail she began to rain showers of burning coals from her tail she brought forth Pahlavas from her udders Drāviḍas and Śakas from her womb  Yavanas from her dung  Śabaras from her urine Kāñcis and from her sides Śarabhas and from the froth of her mouth Pauṇḍras Kirātas Yavanas Siṃhalas Barbaras Vaśas Civukas Pulindas Cīnas Hūṇas Keralas and other Mlecchas who attacked Viśvāmitras soldiers. Viśvāmitras troops fied but none was deprived of life. Viśvāmitra then disgusted with kṣatriya prowess set his mind on asceticism and finally became a  brahman and drank soma with Indra . Kalmāṣapāda  . Vasiṣṭha patiently bore his grief and resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate the Kauśikas. He threw himself n from the summit of Meru entered a huge fire in the forest and tied a strong weight to his neck and threw himself into the sea but all in vain and in distress of heart he returned to his hermitage . Beholding it bereft of his children he left it again and tied himself strongly with cords and flung himself into a mighty river but the stream cut those cords and cast the ṛṣi ashore whence that river was called Vipāśā. Once more he threw himself into a river flowing from Himavat but the river immediately fled in different directions and has since been known by the name of the Śatadru . He now again went towards his hermitage and was on the way addressed by Adṛśyantī the wife of Śaktri who had for twelve years borne his child in her womb. Hearing that child in the womb reciting the Vedas with the six Aṅgas Vasiṣṭha refrained from self destruction and accompanied by Adṛśyantī returned to his hermitage. One day he saw Kalmāṣapāda who would devour him Adṛśyantī was terrified but Vasiṣṭha restrained him by uttering huṃ and sprinkling him with water sanctified by mantras and freed him from his curse that had lasted twelve years. Kalmāṣapāda promised never more to insult brahmans and prevailed upon Vasiṣṭha that he accompanied him to his capital Ayodhyā and begat a son for him on the queen. Then he went back to his hermitage.

Nahuṣa,son of,Āyu,Ājagaraparvan . The Pāṇḍavas spent four years with Arjuna in the gardens of Kubera which added to the preceding six make ten years of exile. In the eleventh year Yudhiṣṭhira advised by Bhīma took leave of those regions determining again to practise austerities on the mountain when he had regained his king and after Lomaśa had returned to the abode of the gods they with the brahmans proceeded along that very road carried by Ghaṭotkaca and his followers and advised also by Ārṣṭiṣeṇa . Having crossed Kailāsa they passed one night in the hermitage of king Vṛṣaparvan then one month at Badarī seeing Kuberas  favourite lake then crossing the land of Cīna Tuṣāra Darada and all the regions of Kulinda and the difficult Himālaya regions they reached the city of the Kirāta king Subāhu where they met with their charioteers Viśoka etc and their servants Mahendrasena etc the cooks and servants of the kitchen. After having stayed there one night they dismissing Ghaṭotkaca and his followers with the charioteers and chariots reached the king of mountains near Yamunā where they dwelt for one year occupied  with hunting in the forest Viśākhayūpa. There in a cavern Bhīma was seized by a snake and rescued by Yudhiṣṭhira. In the twelfth year of their exile they repaired thence to the borders of the desert and desirous of dwelling by the Sarasvatī they went there and thence reached the lake of Dvaitavana . At the request of Janamejaya Vaiśampāyana detailed how Bhīma when they had come from the rājarṣi Vṛṣaparvans hermitage was hunting with unpoisoned  arrows on some spots of Himavat was seized by a huge snake and on account of a boon that had been granted to the serpent was quite unable to extricate himself . The serpent said that he was the rājarṣi Nahuṣa the son of Āyu whom Agastya had cursed to become a serpent out of compassion however adding to his curse that the person who would be able to answer his questions would deliver him and that even stronger beings would when seized by him lose their strength. He had retained his recollection of his former existence and nobody who came within his reach at the sixth division of the day  could escape him. Bhīma lamented. Now appeared dreadful omens to Yudhiṣṭhira there and having learnt from Draupadī that Bhīma had long been out he set out with Dhaumya having directed Arjuna to protect Draupadī and Nakula and Sahadeva to protect the brahmans and in the east following the tracks of Bhīma he came to the spot . The serpent told Yudhi ṣṭhira who he was refused other food instead of Bhīma but promised to deliver him if Yudhiṣṭhira could answer his questions. The first question was about the characteristics of the brahman etc. . Yudhiṣṭhira asked the serpent some questions about the means of salvation and some other moral and philosophical questions about the difference between the mind  and the intellect and what had caused Nahuṣas fall. Nahuṣa told that in heaven he used to exact tribute from brah marṣis gods Rākṣasas Gandharvas Yakṣas Pannagas etc. and that such was the spell of his eyes that on whatever creature he fixed them he instantly destroyed its power Agastya had foretold that Yudhiṣṭhira would save him from his curse. He delivered Bhīma unhurt and assuming his celestial shape went back to heaven. Yudhi ṣṭhira returned with Dhaumya and Bhīma and narrated all that to the brahmans who censured Bhīma and warned him against attempting such things again .
Vasiṣṭha,son of,Varuṇa,Āpavopākhyāna .  Gaṅgā fully related to Śāntanu the reason why the Brahmarṣi Vasiṣṭha the son of Varuṇa had cursed the Vasus. When the Vasus Pṛthu etc were wandering with their wives in the wood near Vasiṣṭhas hermitage frequented by the devarṣis Dyaus was prevailed upon by his wife in the interest of her friend Jitavatī daughter of Uśīnara to steal Vasiṣṭhas homadhenu by drinking whose milk one could remain in unchanged youth for years. Vasiṣṭha however was prevailed upon to let among them Dyaus alone  dwell on earth for a long time without marrying. Then Gaṅgā taking with her the child went away and Śāntanu returned to his capital  shall now recount the virtues of the Bhārata Śāntanu whose splendid story is called the Mahābhārata .
Śarabha,son of,Śicupāla,Arjuna2 Pāṇḍava        . After Pāṇḍu had been cursed that he should have no progeny he caused Dharma to procreate Yudhiṣṭhira in Kuntī then Vāyu to procreate Bhīmasena and then Indra to procreate Arjuna. d In order to propitiate Indra Pāṇḍu took counsel with the maharṣis and caused Kuntī to observe an auspicious vow for a full year while he himself began to stand upon one leg etc. After the birth of A. a bodyless voice said that he should subjugate the Madras the Kurus the Somakas the Cedis Kāśis and Karūṣas and satiate Havyavāhana  in the Khāṇḍava wood with the fat of all beings and with his brothers perform three sacrifices in battle he would gratify Śaṅkara and receive from him the Pāśupata weapon and at the command of Indra slay the Nivātakavacas and acquire all sorts of celestial weapons . On hearing this voice the ascetics dwelling on Śataśṛṅga became ex ceedingly glad. There was heard the sound of dundubhis and flowers were showered n. The various tribes of celestials etc came there . Then the Aśvins procreated the twins Nakula and Sahadeva in Mādrī . Having been procreated on Śataśṛṅga in behalf of Pāṇḍu by the gods Dharma Vāyu Indra and the Aśvins  in Pāṇḍus wives Kuntī and Mādrī the five Pāṇḍavas after the death of Pāṇḍu were brought to Hāstinapura and educated by Droṇa under the supervision of Bhīṣma. Their cousins  hated them especially Duryodhana who tried to murder Bhīmasena and later on all the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī and Karṇa hated Arjuna from jealousy. b One day Droṇa asked his pupils to promise to accomplish what he had on his heart only Arjuna promised it. Arjuna became the foremost of all his fellow pupils. Droṇa gave every one of his pupils a narrow mouthed vessel  for fetching water in order that much time might be spent in filling it but to Aśvatthāman he gave a broad mouthed vessel and in the intervals so gained he used to instruct his son in several superior methods but Arjuna filled the vessel by means of the Vāruṇa weapon and used  to come at the same time as Aśvatthāman. Droṇa told the cook never to give Arjuna his food in the dark but not to tell him that it was he  that had ordered this. One day a wind put the lamp out when Arjuna was taking his food but his hand went up to his mouth from habit. His attention being thus called to the force of habit Arjuna practised with his bow in the night and Droṇa promised him that there should not be a bowman equal to him in the world. He taught him also to fight on horseback etc with the mace etc  . e Arjuna excelled everyone in every respect and alone became an atiratha  f . One day Droṇa caused an artificial bird to be placed on the top of a tree and first repeatedly asked Yudhiṣṭhira to tell what he did see while aiming at the bird. He answered that he saw the tree Droṇa his brothers and the bird. Droṇa reproachfully told him to stand apart. Then Droṇa repeated the experiment with his other pupils with the same result . At last Arjunas turn came he said first that he saw only the vulture and then that he saw only its head and when Droṇa gave the order he struck off its head with his shaft  Arjuna rescued the life of Droṇa by shooting with five arrows an alligator in the Gaṅgā that had seized his thigh. Droṇa gave him the weapon Brahmaśiras on the condition that he should not use it against a human foe as it might burn the whole universe. b Then Arjuna appeared while Kuntī wept with joy and Dhṛtarāṣṭra learned from Vidura who it was. By the Āgneya weapon Arjuna created fire by the Vāruṇa water by the Vāyavya air by the Pārjanya clouds by means of the Pārvata a mountain came into being and by the Antardhāna weapon it again disappeared etc. he at one time shot five shafts together into the mouth of a moving iron boar and discharged twenty one arrows into the hollow of a cows horn hung up in a rope and swaying to and fro  At the show of arms Karṇa in vain challenged Arjuna . Arjuna helped Droṇa to subjugate Drupada which favour Droṇa had asked as his fee. c Droṇa taught Arjuna Brahmaśiras on the condition that he should not hurl it at any human being and obtained from him as his fee the promise that he would fight with him . Then Arjuna went away to the northern region . Headed by Arjuna the Pāṇḍavas in war slew Sauvīra who had performed a three years sacrifice at the inroad of the Gandharvas. The Yavana king whom even Pāṇḍu had failed to subject was subdued by Arjuna as was also the Sauvīra Vitula who had always shown a dis regard for the Kurus and the Sauvīra Sumitra called Dattāmitra  assisted by Bhīma Arjuna with only a single chariot subjugated all the kings of the east  backed by chariots and in the  same way the south. Dhṛtarāṣṭras sentiments towards the Pāṇḍavas suddenly became poisoned and from anxiety he could not sleep             The Pāṇḍavas went to the Pāñcāla land in the company of brahmans who told them of the svayaṃvara etc.. On their way they beheld Vyāsa they took up their quarters in the house of a potter and ating the brahmanical profession they began to lead an eleemosynary life. Drupada always wished to bestow his daughter on Kirīṭin and therefore caused a very stiff bow to be made which was incapable of being bent by anybody except Arjuna When Duryodhana etc had in vain tried to string the bow and Karṇa though having succeeded in stringing it had as a sūta been rejected by Kṛṣṇā Jiṣṇu  came forward Some of the brahmans spoke reproachingly of Arjunas daring undertaking some approved of it. Bending his head unto Īśāna and remembering Kṛṣṇa Arjuna accomplished the task Kṛṣṇā approached Arjuna who soon after left the lists followed by her When Drupada expressed his desire of bestowing his daughter on that brahman the kings resolved to slay Drupada and burn Kṛṣṇā but spare Arjuna whom they took for a brahman Arjuna and Bhīmasena rescued them Kṛṣṇa knew the Pāṇḍavas Karṇa is defeated by Arjuna etc. Bhīmasena and Arjuna with difficulty escaped from the throng followed by Kṛṣṇā When they came with Kṛṣṇā Kuntī said enjoy ye all Yudhiṣṭhira declared that Arjuna should wed her but agreed that she should be the common wife of them all Dhṛṣṭadyumna secretly followed Bhīmasena and  Arjuna and from their conversation learned who they were Dhṛṣṭadyumna related what had happened Arjuna is said to have large red eyes  from their conversation he concluded that they were the Pāṇḍavas of whom it had been heard that they had all escaped from the house of lac Drupada vowed to restore Yudhiṣṭhira on his paternal throne he became very perplexed at the project of marrying Kṛṣṇā to all the five brothers meanwhile Vyāsa arrived Vidura and Dhṛtarāṣṭra became glad at the Pāṇḍavas having won Kṛṣṇā but Duryodhana and Karṇa tried to stir Dhṛtarāṣṭra up against them Duryodhana proposed several means of getting the better of the Pāṇḍavas etc Dhṛtarāṣṭra caused the Pāṇḍavas together with Kuntī and Kṛṣṇā to repair to Khāṇḍavaprastha giving them half the king The Pāṇḍavas reigned in prosperity at Indraprastha once Arjuna having violated an established rule regarding Kṛṣṇā set out to live twelve years in the forest Arjuna was drawn away to the bottom of the water by Ulūpī  she said that he would be invincible in water A. visited many tīrthas married Citrāṅgādā at Maṇipūra where he dwelled for three years she gave birth to a son f A. visited the tīrthas of the southern ocean where he liberated the apsaras Vargā etc in Nārītīrthāni A. visits Kṛṣṇa  A. carried away Subhadrā the sister of Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa reconciled A. with the Bhojas etc. A. married Subhadrā and passed a whole year at Dvārakā then Kṛṣṇa remained for some time with A. at Indraprastha Subhadrā brought forth Abhimanyu who became the favourite of Kṛṣṇa and from his father acquired the Dhanurveda. Kṛṣṇā also obtained five sons who after having studied the Vedas from Arjuna acquired knowledge of all weapons celestial and human Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna assisted Agni in burning the Khāṇḍava forest Agni caused Varuṇa to give Arjuna the Gāṇḍīva bow two inexhaustible quivers and a car yoked with horses then Agni gave Kṛṣṇa the discus Sudarśana Varuṇa gave Kṛṣṇa the mace Kaumodakī Indra in vain poured n showers of rain in order to prevent the burning. An incorporeal voice said that Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna being really the old ṛṣis and gods Nara and Nārāyaṇa were invincible. Indra appeared and promised to give Arjuna all his weapons when Mahādeva had been pleased by him he granted Kṛṣṇa that his friendship with Arjuna should be eternal. The car  which Varuṇa gave to Arjuna was furnished with celestial weapons etc and incapable of being vanquished by gods or Asuras its banner bore a large monkey the car was drawn by horses white as silver born in the region of the Gandharvas and harnessed with gold and in speed resembling the wind or the mind its splenr was great and the sound of its wheels was tremens it had been created by the  Prajāpati Bhaumana  after severe ascetic meditation no one could gaze at its splenr it was the very car riding upon which Soma had vanquished the Dānavas it was furnished with an excellent flagstaff of golden colour upon which was seen a celestial ape apparently bent upon burning everything it beheld and upon the flags were seen various creatures of large size whose roars and yells caused the enemys soldiers to faint Maya asked Arjuna to tell him what he was to for him because he had been rescued by him in the Khāṇḍava forest Arjuna told him to something for Kṛṣṇa who causes him to build a palace for Yudhiṣṭhira  Maya told Arjuna about the huge riches on Hiraṇyaśṛṅga and gave Arjuna the conch shell Devadatta etc. the palace was constructed in fourteen months Among those who waited on Yudhiṣṭhira in the palace were the princes who dressed in deer skins learned the science of arms under Arjuna Yudhi ṣṭhira consulted his brothers etc as to the rājasūya all people lived happily Arjuna protected the people from enemies etc Deliberation about slaying Jarāsandha Some objections made by Yudhiṣṭhira are refuted by A Approving the words of Arjuna Kṛṣṇa related the origin of Jarāsandha A. set out with Bhīmasena and Kṛṣṇa to slay Jarā sandha They entered the city of Girivraja in the guise of snātakas etc The combat between Bhīma and Jarāsandha having lasted for thirteen days Bhīma killed him on the fourteenth night they installed Jarāsandhas son Sahadeva as king of Magadha then they returned to Indraprastha on Jarāsandhas celestial car Kṛṣṇa set out for Dvārakā Having obtained the bow A etc prevailed upon Yudhiṣṭhira to let him subdue the north A. set out on that celestial car which he had obtained from Agni and subdued the north while his brothers subdued the other regions and Yudhiṣṭhira stayed at Indraprastha.  Arjuna subdued the Kulindas Ānarttas Kālakūtas Sumaṇḍala and with him Śākala dvīpa and king Prativindhya and the kings in Śākala dvīpa and the Seven Islands and together with them he vanquished Bhagadatta king of Prāgjyotiṣa and friend of Indra who was surrounded by Kirātas Cīnas and other warriors dwelling on the sea coast after eight days of combat Arjuna prevailed upon him to give tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira at his will . Having vanquished all the mountain kings of the north he subdued Bṛhanta the mountain king dwelling in Ulūka and with him Senāvindu at the command of Yudhiṣṭhira he stayed at Devaprastha the city of Senāvindu while his troops subjugated Modāpura Vāmadeva Sudāman Susaṅkula and the Northern Ulūkas. Then having vanquished the moun taineers he conquered the town of the Paurava king Viśvagaśva then the seven tribes of the Utsavasaṅketas etc. Having conquered the Himavat and Niṣkuṭa he came to Śvetaparvata . Having crossed Śvetaparvata he subdued the country of the Kimpuruṣas ruled by Drumaputra then by conciliatory proceedings the country named Hāṭaka defended by Guhyakas. Then he came to the Mānasa lake and all the sacred waters .  Then he conquered the region of the Gandharvas and took as tribute from the Gandharva city horses spotted as partridges and named maṇḍūkas .

After having dwelt in the abode of Indra for five years and obtained all celestial weapons from him viz Āgneya Vāruṇa Saumya Vāyavya Vaiṣṇava Aindra Pāśupata Brāhmya Pārameṣṭhya likewise those of Prajāpati Yama Dhātṛ Savitṛ Tvaṣtṛ and Vaiśravaṇa Arjuna took leave of Indra and came to Gandhamādana f One  day the Pāṇḍavas saw Arjuna descending to them with Mātali on Indras car A. gave Draupadī precious gems presented to him by Indra the next morning Indra visited them When Indra had gone. A. related his journey against the Kirāta he had in vain employed the Vāyavya Sthūṇākarṇa Jāla and the Śalabhāstra and showers of shafts and stones as the Kirāta had swallowed them all and he had in vain discharged the Brahmāstra Arjuna continued his tale he enumerated a great many weapons the use of which Indra promised to teach him Mātali wondered that Arjuna was not jerked on the car of Indra though Indra himself got jerked at the first pull of the steeds when he had learned the use of the weapons Indra had said that not even the gods could now conquer him he had received fifteen weapons and learnt five ways of using them Indra had asked him as his fee to slay the Nivātakavacas and had given him the car  upon which he  had vanquished Bali etc and this diadem and ornaments of his own and the impenetrable mail and he had fastened this durable  string to the Gāṇḍīva and the gods gave him the shell Devadatta by which Indra had conquered the worlds  f Arjuna related his victory over the Nivātakavacas Indra had formerly been told by Svayambhū that he himself would destroy them in another body as the gods were unable to slay them Indra had presented those weapons to Arjuna in order to have them killed. Then Arjuna and Mātali again went to the abode of the gods While returning A. destroyed Hiraṇyapura inhabited by Paulomas and Kālakhañjas who could not be slain even by the gods etc. therefore Brahmán had determined that Arjuna a mortal should kill them he employed the Raudra weapon.

As the Gandharvas would not set free Duryodhana etc as requested by Arjuna a fierce battle ensued The Gandharvas in vain attempted to break the cars of the Pāṇḍavas especially Arjuna sent millions of them to the abode of Yama by means of his Āgneya weapon. The Gandharvas then rose up to the skies taking the Dhārtarāṣṭras with them showering maces darts etc upon Arjuna who killed them with his weapons Sthūṇākarṇa Indrajāla Saura Āgneya and Saumya. At last Citrasena rushed at Arjuna armed with a mace of iron when Arjuna had cut that mace into seven pieces with his arrows Citrasena by means of his science concealed himself from the view of Arjuna and thus continued to fight with him but Arjuna destroyed his power of concealing himself by shooting at him with his celestial arms guided by the sound . Then Citrasena showed himself to Arjuna reminding him that he was his friend and the battle was interrupted Citrasena relates that he had been acquainted with the purpose of Duryodhana etc and had been requested by Indra to bring Duryodhana thither in chains Arjuna entreated him to set Duryodhana free but at the request of Citrasena they left the matter to be decided by Yudhiṣṭhira Yudhiṣṭhira then liberated all the Kauravas Duryodhana renounced all food from shame as he had been liberated by Arjuna The Dānavas  in Pātāla comforted Duryodhana saying that Naraka who had been reborn as Karṇa would slay Arjuna etc and that the Saṃśaptakas possessed by the Rākṣasas were desirous of slaying Arjuna etc Karṇa promised to slay Arjuna Duryodhana was comforted The Pāṇḍavas left Dvaitavana and repaired to the Kāmyaka forest The Sindhu king Jayadratha saw Kṛṣṇā and became enamoured of her. Koṭikāsya introduced him to Kṛṣṇā. She said that her husbands were hunting Arjuna to the west etc. Jayadratha was treated hospitably by Kṛṣṇā and asked her to leave the miserable Pāṇḍavas and become his wife She threatened him with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna etc but at last she was obliged to ascend his chariot. The Pāṇḍavas overtook Jayadratha Kṛṣṇā showed Jaya dratha each of the five Pāṇḍavas Arjuna killed the twelve Sauvīra heroes etc. Jayadratha etc fled Arjuna exhorted Bhīma to refrain from slaughtering the remnant of the Saindhava host Bhīma and Arjuna went in search of Jayadratha Arjuna killed the horses of Jayadratha but entreated Bhīma not to kill himself Jayadratha obtained from Śiva that he should be able to defeat all the five Pāṇḍavas but Arjuna was invincible being in reality Nara who had formerly practised austerities in Badarī and had acquired the thunderbolt etc from the Lokapālas and was protected by Kṛṣṇa.

During Kṛṣṇas embassy Kuntī compared A. to Arjuna Kārtavīrya and mentioned the invisible voices in the night of Arjunas birth  Kṛṣṇa mentioned Arjunas exploits before Duryodhana and said that Bhīṣma etc could not contend with Bhīma and A Kuntī asked Kṛṣṇa to remind A. of the voice heard at his birth and tell him always to tread in the path pointed out by Draupadī that Bhīma and Arjuna like two Yamas were capable of slaying the very gods etc. Bhīṣma and Droṇa reminded Duryodhana of the exploits of A.

The Pāṇḍavas  and Sṛñjaya were defeated by Droṇa Yudhiṣṭhira asked A. to check Droṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra regretted that Duryodhana did not know Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna ELEVENTH DAY Droṇa promised to seize Yudhiṣṭhira if he was not protected by Arjuna  Arjuna must therefore be with drawn from Yudhiṣṭhira. Yudhiṣṭhira learnt through his spies that Droṇa had promised to seize him A. consoled him. A fierce battle commenced protected by Droṇa and Arjuna both hosts seemed to stand inactive. In order to rescue Yudhiṣṭhira A. attacked Droṇas division. When the sun set both parties withdrew their troops. The Pāṇḍavas etc praised Arjuna Droṇa confessed his inability of seizing Yudhiṣṭhira if Arjuna were by the Trigarta king saying that Arjuna had always injured them said that they would take an oath that either Arjuna or the Trigartas should be slain. Then they summoned Arjuna to the southern part of the field. Arjuna told Satyajit to guard Yudhiṣṭhira and went out against the Trigartas TWELFTH DAY The Saṃśaptakas rejoiced at the prospect of fighting with A who terrified them with the sound of Devadatta and attacked them Subāhu and Suśarman etc fought with A. they fled to Duryodhana but urged by the Trigarta king they once more returned to the field with the Nārāyaṇa cowherds. Kṛṣṇa conveyed Arjuna to the Saṃśaptakas. The Nārāyaṇas fought with Arjuna. A. blew the Devadatta and employed the Tvāṣṭra weapon that confounded the foes who began to strike each other Arjuna crossed the Lalitthas etc and used the Vāyavya weapon to frustrate the npour of arrows shot by his foes and Vāyu bore away crowds of Saṃśaptakas with their steeds etc. Yudhiṣṭhira disposed his troops in the form of a semicircle. Yudhiṣṭhira fled. Arjunas son Śrutakīrti fought with the son of Duḥśāsana. A etc fought with Bhagadatta . Urged by Arjuna Kṛṣṇa began to proceed against Bhagadatta the Saṃśaptakas  challenged Arjuna and he encountered them discharged the Brāhma weapon defeated and slew them and then turned against Bhagadatta but as Suśarman with his brothers followed him from behind he again attacked Suśarman and then again Bhagadatta Bhagadatta at last consecrated his hook with mantras so as to become the Vaiṣṇava weapon Kṛṣṇa received it on his breast and it became a garland. As A. taxed Kṛṣṇa for fighting himself Kṛṣṇa related the history of the Vaiṣṇavāstra  the great Asura has now been divested of that supreme weapon now slay Bhagadatta that enemy of the gods just as formerly slew the Asura Naraka for the good of the worlds A. then slew both Bhagadatta and the elephant. Then A. slew the two brothers Vṛṣa and Acala. Dhṛtarāṣṭras sons attacked Arjuna and Śakuni employed magics in order to confound him and Kṛṣṇa producing clubs etc and asses etc which A. slew with celestial weapons then darkness whence harsh voices were heard this A. dispelled with the weapon Jyotiṣka then waves of water which were dried up with the Āditya weapon Śakuni fled. A. slaughtered  the Kuru army some followed Droṇa others Duryodhana a fierce battle took place on the southern side between Arjuna and the Kurus. The Pāṇḍavas regretted that Arjuna was engaged on the southern part of the field in slaughtering the Saṃśaptakas and the Nārāyaṇa force. Having slain the Saṃśaptakas Arjuna fought with Droṇa etc employing the Āgneya weapon A. slew three of Karṇas brothers . At sunset the armies retired THIRTEENTH DAY Being overcome by A and Droṇa having failed to seize Yudhiṣṭhira the Kurus were regarded as defeated they heard everybody praise A. and Kṛṣṇa. Next morning Duryodhana blamed Droṇa for not having seized Yudhiṣṭhira Droṇa said that nobody could defeat the force protected by Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa save Mahādeva. The Saṃśaptakas challenged Arjuna and took him away to the southern side of the field. The Pāṇḍavas were headed by Bhīmasena. Abhimanyu defeated all the warriors that encountered him with the weapons he had received from Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. At last Abhimanyu was slain by Duḥśāsanas son after Jayadratha had checked those who tried to follow Abhimanyu Vyāsa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira who became free from grief but what shall we say to Arjuna In the evening Arjuna after having slain large numbers of Saṃśaptakas proceeded towards his tent and told Kṛṣṇa that his heart was afflicted he saw indications of disaster Abhimanyu did not come out with smiles to receive him etc. He remembered that Droṇa had this day formed the circular array which none save Abhimanyu could break but he had not taught him how to come out of it after having pierced it he had heard the leonine shouts of the Dhārtarāṣṭras and Kṛṣṇa had heard Yuyutsu censuring them for having slain a child instead of Arjuna and then Yuyutsu had cast up his weapons afflicted with rage and grief. Kṛṣṇa consoled Arjuna talking about the kṣattriya duties and heaven. None save Kṛṣṇa and Yudhiṣṭhira  could address Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira addressed him and told  him the particulars of Abhimanyus heroism and fall. Arjuna vowed to slay Jayadratha before the sun set the following day  even as to As  men birds snakes P wanderers of the night B. ṛ and . ṛ etc he said that they would not succeed in protecting him even if he entered Rasātala or ascended the firmament or repaired to the city of the gods  or the city of Diti  if the sun set before he had slain him he would himself enter the fire. Arjuna bent the Gāṇḍīva Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñca janya Arjuna the Devadatta . Having been informed by spies Jayadratha was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear thinking that not even Droṇa not even  G As U Rā could protect him against Arjuna. He wished to return home. Duryodhana comforted him saying that he Karṇa etc would protect him. Accompanied by Duryodhana Jaya dratha that very night repaired to Droṇa and questioned him about the difference between himself and Arjuna. Droṇa said they had got the same instruction but Arjuna was superior to Jayadratha in consequence of yoga and the hard life he had led Droṇa would however protect him forming an  impenetrable array and moreover death ought not to be an object of terror to him . Kṛṣṇa remonstrated with A. for his rash vow the Kurus had expected an attack by A. now they would protect Jayadratha  encounter with Śiva Hiraṇyapura etc. Karṇa etc would be in Jayadrathas van Droṇas array would be half a śakaṭa and half a lotus with a needle mouthed array in the middle .

The gods including Indra became very anxious. Sinister omens appeared in nature. Kṛṣṇa went to A.s abode and consoled Subhadrā  . Subhadrā bewailed Abhimanyu and said Shame on Bhīmasena etc because they had not protected him. Draupadī and Uttarā came to her lamenting. Kṛṣṇa said that Abhimanyu had attained the most laudable and enviable goal. Then he returned to A. . A. performed his usual nightly sacrifice to Śiva. Kṛṣṇa with Dāruka repaired to his own tent. None in the Pāṇḍava camp slept that night thinking of A. In the middle of the night Kṛṣṇa said to Dāruka that he had resolved to fight the next day  he must equip his chariot placing Kaumodakī etc on it making room for Garuḍa and yoking Balāhaka etc to it when hearing Pāñcajanya emitting the shrill Ṛṣabha note he should come to Kṛṣṇa . A. saw Kṛṣṇa in a dream who told him not to grieve and mentioned the Pāśupata weapon  if he remembered it now he would be able to slay Jayadratha next day otherwise he must pray to Śiva. At the Brāhma hour A. saw himself sojourning through the sky with Kṛṣṇa to where Śiva was seated with Pārvatī   Kṛṣṇa and A. praised Mahādeva . A. beheld the offerings that Śiva made every night to Kṛṣṇa and he mentally aed both Kṛṣṇa and Śiva. Śiva told them to bring Śivas bow and arrow from a lake of amṛta. In the lake they saw two terrible snakes when they had uttered the Brahma Śatarudriya the snakes assumed the forms of a bow and arrow from Śivas body there came out a brahmacārin with blue throat and red locks and having showed A. the use of the bow and arrow and the mantras he sped these weapons to that same lake. Having thus once more obtained the Pāśupata weapon A. and Kṛṣṇa came back to their own camp  FOURTEENTH DAY Yudhiṣṭhira underwent his morning rites  Kṛṣṇa visited Yudhiṣṭhira . Then also Virāṭa etc arrived. Yudhiṣṭhira asked Kṛṣṇa to rescue the Pāṇḍavas quoting Nārada. Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhi ṣṭhira of Arjunas success .

Yudhiṣṭhira heard the blare of Pāñcajanya and thought A. to be in distress he requested Sātyaki to go to A. and bring him intelligence of his safety A. had said in the Dvaita wood to Yudhiṣṭhira even if Kṛṣṇa etc assists us shall yet appoint Sātyaki for our aid since there is none equal to him and Yudhiṣṭhira had witnessed his reverence for A. at Dvārakā after his return from the tīrthas etc. the day is about to end Pradyumna and Sātyaki are equal to A. in bravery . Sātyaki hesitated to comply with Yudhiṣṭhiras request on the ground of a counter command by A. the Sauvīrakas etc  As men Rā K M. U etc cannot cope with A. in battle . Sātyaki agreed to obey Yudhi ṣṭhiras order the distance from here is yojanas he would crush the elephants of the Añjana breed mounted by Mlecchas who at Karṇas command had returned from the pursuit of A. and were waiting for Sātyaki and likewise crush those elephants mounted by Kirātas  and formerly given by the Kirāta king to A. . Yuyudhāna proceeded towards the chariot of A. . Yudhiṣṭhira was anxious because he had not obtained any news of A. and Sātyaki and thought of sending Bhīma after Sātyaki Bhīma penetrated to Arjuna making his presence known by a roar A. and Kṛṣṇa uttered loud roars in return Yudhiṣṭhira understood that all was safe and recalled A.s feats  .

Uddālaka gave his own daughter Sujātā in marriage together with sacred learning to his disciple the brahman Kahoda who had served him long. The embryo in her womb had become versed in the Śāstras and the Vedas with the aṅgas and blamed Kahoda who had been reading the whole night. The great ṛṣi Kahoda cursed him to become crooked on eight parts of his body wherefore he when born was called Aṣṭāvakra. In order to procure wealth for Sujātā Kahoda went to king Janaka where he was defeated in a controversy with the sūta  Bandin and was immersed into water. Uddālaka prevailed upon Sujātā to keep it a secret from Aṣṭāvakra who regarded Uddālaka as his father and Śvetaketu the son of Uddālaka who was of the same age with himself as his brother until in his th year Śvetaketu in anger happened to disclose the matter to him. He and Śvetaketu then went to the sacrifice of Janaka and on being driven from the entrance Aṣṭāvakra met the king and in the course of a conversation with him and the rkeeper he compared Janaka to Yayāti and said that he had heard that Bandin caused those whom he had vanquished in disputation to be drowned in the sea by men sent by Janaka and he declared that he had come to maintain the unity with Bráhman  and to defeat Bandin then he answered several enigmatical questions  and was admitted . Here they disputed in such a way that Bandin enumerated things of which there is only Aṣṭāvakra groups of Ba of A of etc Ba of A of Ba of A of Ba of A of Ba of A of . As Bandin had said the first half śloka with he stopped and Aṣṭāvakra fulfilled the śloka. Bandin was then deemed to be vanquished and at the request of Aṣṭāvakra he merged into the sea after he had declared himself to be the son of Varuṇa and that he had caused the brahmans to be drowned in order that they might see the twelve years sattra of Varuṇa that was performed simultaneously with that of Janaka. They at once reappeared and Kahoda let Aṣṭāvakra bathe in the river Samaṅgā and all his limbs were immediately made straight and the Samaṅgā became a remover of sin. There fore you also should bathe there .

Śiśupāla,son of,Damaghoṣa,Śiśupālavadhaparvan . As Yudhiṣṭhira was afraid that his sacrifice might be obstructed Bhīṣma consoled him saying that Kṛṣṇa was invincible . Śiśupāla again censured Bhīṣma and Kṛṣṇa and compared Bhīṣma to the old swan who always preached of virtue so that the other birds gave him food and kept their eggs with him but the old swan used to eat up their eggs till he was found out and slain . Śiśupāla censured Kṛṣṇas behaviour towards Jarāsandha Bhīma rushed up in anger but was restrained by Bhīṣma while Śiśupāla was boasting . Bhīṣma said Śiśupāla was born with three eyes and four hands and brayed like an ass his parents resolved to aban him but were prevented by an incorporeal voice who foreboded that that man in whose lap the child would be sitting when its superfluous arms would fall n and the third eye on its forehead disappear should be its slayer. Though the child was placed upon the laps of kings this came not to pass until Rāma and Kṛṣṇa went to the capital of the Cedis to see their fathers sister when the boy was placed on the lap of Kṛṣṇa then the arms fell n and the eye disappeared. Kṛṣṇa granted to Śiśupālas mother the boon that he would par offences of Śiśupālas . Bhīṣma declared that Kṛṣṇa himself had wanted to provoke the boast of Śiśupāla. Śiśupāla reproached Bhīṣma because he did not rather praise the other kings such as the Bālhika king Darada or Karṇa etc. he compared Bhīṣma to the bird Bhūliṅga . Bhīṣma expressed his contempt for such talk. The kings became angry and proposed to kill Bhīṣma who relied upon Kṛṣṇa . Śiśupāla challenged Kṛṣṇa being desirous to slay him with all the Pāṇḍavas. Kṛṣṇa related  how Śiśupāla hearing that the Sātvatas had gone to Prāgjyotiṣa came and burnt Dvārakā  that when king Bhoja was sporting on the Raivataka hill he fell upon his attendants and slew many of them and led many away in  chains to his own city  in order to obstruct the sacrifice of Kṛṣṇas father he stole the sacrificial horse that had been let loose under the guard of armed men  that he ravished the reluctant wife of Babhru on her way from Hāstinapura  to the Sauvīras  that disguising himself in the attire of the Kārūṣa king he had ravished Bhadrā Vaiśālī   that he had desired Rukmiṇī but failed to obtain her  that he  had promised to par him times and that the number had now become full. Kṛṣṇa then thought of his discus which came into his hand therewith he instantly cut off the head of Śiśupāla the kings beheld a fiery energy issuing out of the body of Śiśupāla and entering Kṛṣṇas body the sky though cloudless poured showers of rain etc. Yudhiṣṭhira caused his brothers to perform the funeral rites of Śiśupāla the son of Damaghoṣa then he with all the kings installed the son of Śiśupāla in the sovereignty of the Cedis v.

Bali,son of,Virocana,Dvaitavanapraveśa  . The Pāṇḍavas with Kṛṣṇa and Dhaumya on costly chariots yoked with excellent steeds went into the forest distributing niṣkas of gold etc to brahmans versed in Śikṣā akṣara and mantras and followed by twenty attendants with bows etc while Indrasena with the princesss  clothes and ornaments and the nurses and maidservants followed in a chariot. The citizens walked round Yudhiṣṭhira and the brahmans and principal men of Kurujāṅgala of all castes saluted him and blamed the Dhārtarāṣṭras etc. Arjuna told them that after their exile they would take away the good name of their enemies and asked them to beseech the ascetics for their good. At last they returned to their respective abodes . After a conference between Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna they resolved upon dwelling for these twelve years at the sacred lake Dvaitavana  in the forest of the same name on the banks of Bhogavatī surrounded by many brahmans and saluted  by hosts of Cāraṇas and Siddhas who came to see Yudhi ṣṭhira . While they were dwelling there Dhaumya performed their iṣṭis  and offerings to the Pitṛs etc. Once the old ṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya came to them and smiled recollecting Rāma Dāśarathi whom he had seen on the top of the Ṛṣyamūka and comforted Yudhiṣṭhira by reminding him of the aforesaid Rāma Nābhāga Bhagīratha etc and Alarka the king of the Kāśis and the Karūṣas the seven ṛṣis who had followed the ordinance of the Creator and therefore blazed in the firmament so you will regain prosperity. Then he went away in a northerly direction . The Dvaitavana forest becoming filled with brahmans and always resounding with Vedic recitations mingling with the twangs of the bows of the Pāṇḍavas a beautiful union of brahman and kṣatriya customs was produced. Therefore one evening the ṛṣi Baka Dālbhya represented to Yudhiṣṭhira that the kṣatriya should always consult with a brahman as did the Asura king Bali the son of Virocana who went to no other tīrtha than the brahmans and then had all his wishes gratified but who met with destruction when he began to act unjustly towards them. Then all those brahmans Dvaipāyana Nārada Jāmadagnya etc praised Yudhiṣṭhira .

Garuḍa,son of,Kaśyapa,Garuḍa the son of Kaśyapa and Vinatā the vehicle of Viṣṇu or the emblem of his flagstaff  . b  In the meantime G. came out bursting the egg and ascended the skies. The gods thought that it was Agni but were undeceived .  Then the gods and the ṛṣis praised G. and prevailed upon him to diminish his own energy and splenr . Bearing his brother Aruṇa on his back G. went from his fathers home and arrived at his mothers side on the other shore of the ocean and placed Aruṇa in the east . b  G. carried the snakes on his back but ascended too near to the Sun so that the snakes became scorched by the rays of the Sun .  The serpents promised that if G. brought them the amṛta he and his mother should be freed from bondage . Having been directed by Vinatā to live upon the Niṣādas  but not to injure the brahmans and being taught by her how to know who is a brahman he set out and having come to the Niṣādas he raised a great quantity of dust and opened his mouth there the Niṣādas entered by thousands being blinded by the dust and were devoured . A brahman who with his wife of the Niṣāda caste entered the throat of G and began to burn him was recognized and relieved with his wife by G . As G.s hunger was not appeased Kaśyapa told him of the elephant Supratīka  and the tortoise Vibhāvasu . Then Kaśyapa blessed G . G. then seized the elephant and the tortoise and came to the tīrtha Alamba  . A banyan tree invited him to sit on one of its huge branches but the branch broke . G. caught the branch with his beak and perceiving Vālakhilyas suspended therefrom with their head nwards he continued to fly with the branch the elephant and the tortoise fearing to kill the Vālakhilyas if he should throw away the branch. The Vālakhilyas therefore gave him the name Garuḍa . On Gandhamādana he saw Kaśyapa engaged in ascetic devotions. Kaśyapa propitiated the Vālakhilyas  for him then they abaned the bough and went to Himavat to practise ascetic penances. According to the advice of Kaśyapa G. flew away for  a hundred thousand of yojanas to a mountain without human beings there he threw n the bough and ate the tortoise and the elephant. Then he again rose on his wings . Omens foreboding fear began to appear among the gods. Bṛhaspati declared that it was owing to the fault of Indra and the ascetic penances of the Vālakhilyas  that G. now approached to take away the soma. Indra then caused the gods to surround and watch the amṛta  .  G. attacked the gods whom he blinded with dust and Bhaumana lay as dead on the field. Indra caused Vāyu to dispel the dust. The Sādhyas and the Gandharvas fled eastwards the Vasus and the Rudras towards the south the Ādityas towards the west and the Aśvins towards the north. G. then slew nine Yakṣas Aśvakranda etc who guarded the amṛta. The amṛta on all sides was surrounded with fire. G. then divided his mouth into mouths and taking water from many rivers he extinguished the fire. Then he assumed a diminutive body and passed through the spokes of the revolving keen edged wheel of steel placed before the soma. Then there were two great snakes who would reduce to ashes everyone who might be seen by them. G. covered their eyes with dust and unseen by them mangled them to pieces. He then flew away with the amṛta not drinking it himself. He met with Viṣṇu on his way and they agreed that G. should stay above Viṣṇu sitting on the flagstaff of his chariot and be his vehicle and be immortal and free from disease without drinking amṛta. While G. was flying Indra hurled his thunderbolt at him. G. did not feel the slightest pain but in honour of Dadhīca and Indra and the thunderbolt G. dropped a feather and from its beauty he gained the name Suparṇa . Indra and G. made friendship with each other and agreed that G. should not give the soma to anyone for drink. Indra should bring it away after it had been put n by G and G. should feed on the snakes. The snakes declared Vinatā to be free G. placed n the soma on some kuśa grass and while the snakes were performing their ablutions their daily devotions and other religious rites Indra took up the amṛta and reṭurned to heaven. When the snakes licked the kuśa grass their tongues were divided in twain and the kuśa grass from the contact with the amṛta became sacred from this time . bis .              . u . c .  . Cf.

Sahadeva,son of,Jarāsandha,. As Kṛṣṇa thought that Jarāsandha was incapable of being vanquished in battle even by all the gods and Asuras but might be vanquished in a personal struggle with bare arms and as there was in himself policy in Bhīma strength and in Arjuna ability to protect them he thought that Jarāsandha should be made to challenge Bhīma and Kṛṣṇa therefore obtained the permission of Yudhiṣṭhira that Bhīma and Arjuna followed him. They set out in the garb of snātakas with Bhīma in the van from the land of the Kurus to the Padmasaras over Kālakūṭa Gaṇḍakī Mahāśoṇa Sadānīrā the rivers on the Ekaparvataka  and Pūrvā  Kośalā Mithilā Mālā Carmaṇvatī Gaṅgā Śoṇa towards the east dressed in garments of kuśa grass to the Māgadha land. When they came to the mountain of Goratha they beheld the Māgadha town . Girivraja is  surrounded by the five large hills of Vaihāra Varāha Vṛṣabha Ṛṣigiri and Caityaka. It was there that Gautama begat Kākṣīvat etc upon the śūdra woman Auśīnarī and was visited by the kings of Aṅga Vaṅga etc. There dwell the Nāgas Arbuda Śakravāpin Svastika and Maṇināga. Manu had ordered the Māgadhas never to be afflicted with drought Kauśika and Maṇimat had favoured the country. The Pāṇḍavas and Kṛṣṇa entered the city by breaking n the peak of Caityaka worshipped by the Bārhadrathas and the citizens with perfumes and flower garlands where Bṛhadratha had slain the cannibal Ṛṣabha and made of his hide  three drums . As evil omens had been seen the purohitas made Jarāsandha mount an elephant and carried fire about him and he entered upon  a sacrifice with vows  and fasts . Kṛṣṇa Bhīma and Dhanañjaya entered the city without weapons in the guise of snātakas snatched from the flower vens the garlands they had exposed for sale and attired in robes of various colours and decked with garlands and ear rings they entered the abode of Jarāsandha who welcomed them and hearing from Kṛṣṇa that Bhīma and Arjuna in consequence of a vow would not speak before night quartered them in the sacrificial apartments  and retired to the palace . At midnight he came to them as he always observed the vow that as soon as he should hear of the arrival of snātakas even at midnight he would immediately come out and grant them an audience. As he questioned them about their strange attire which was unsuitable for snātakas and their breaking n the Caityaka peak and why they would not accept the worship he offered Kṛṣṇa gave him some explanations and declared that they had come as his foes . As Jarāsandha said that he did not remember to have injured them Kṛṣṇa told him that they were sent by Yudhiṣṭhira to set at liberty the princes whom Jarāsandha intended to slaughter as a sacrifice to Śiva because sacrificing human beings to the gods was never used  he reminded him of the destruction of Dambhodbhava Kārta vīrya Uttara and Bṛhadratha and challenged him to set free the monarchs or to fight. Jarāsandha chose to fight and ordered Sahadeva to be installed on the throne. Then he thought of his generals Kauśika and Citrasena who had formerly been Haṃsa and Ḍimbhaka. Kṛṣṇa remembering that according to the command of Brahmán Jarāsandha was not to be slain by him or by the Madhus did not himself desire to slay him . Jarāsandha having chosen to fight with Bhīma the purohita brought pigment garlands etc and propitiatory ceremonies  were performed by a brahman and likewise Bhīma having consulted with Kṛṣṇa had propitiatory ceremonies pronounced . When Jarāsandha had taken off his crown and arranged his hair they fought with their clenched fists as their only weapons. The combat began at the first day of the month Kārttika and lasted without intermission or food till the thirteenth on the fourteenth night Jarāsandha desisted from fatigue and Kṛṣṇa obscurely intimated that he should now be killed . At the instigation of Kṛṣṇa Bhīma threw Jarāsandha into the air a hundred times pressed his knee against his backbone and broke his body in two with  a terrible roar so that the citizens became dumb with terror and many women were prematurely delivered. Leaving the lifeless body at the palace gate they went out of the town riding on Jarāsandhas celestial chariot which Kṛṣṇa caused to be made ready it being aned with a celestial flagstaff and incapable of being vanquished by any king upon which Indra and Viṣṇu had fought in the battle about Tārakā riding upon which Indra had slain ninety nine  Dānavas which had been obtained by king Vasu from Vāsava from Vasu by Bṛhadratha and from him by Jarāsandha. And Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa who sat upon the chariot along with the frightfully roaring creatures on its flagstaff. Kṛṣṇa then released his relatives and ordered them to assist Yudhiṣṭhira at his rājasūya. Stopping on a level plain outside the town he was aed by the citizens and he installed Sahadeva the son of Jarāsandha in the sovereignty of the Magadhas. Then they arrived at Indra prastha. Thereupon Kṛṣṇa having taken leave of Yudhi ṣṭhira etc set out for his own city riding upon that same celestial chariot that had been given to him by Yudhiṣṭhira the Pāṇḍavas having circumambulated him
brahman,son of,Bṛhaspati,Kaca a brahman the son of Bṛhaspati.  Janamejaya said How did Yayāti get Devayānī Vaiśampā yana related In the many battles between the gods and the Asuras the gods had for their purohita Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa and the Asuras Uśanas Kāvya . As Uśanas by his science Sañjīvinī restored the fallen Dānavas to life and Bṛhaspati was unable to revive the fallen gods the gods prevailed upon Bṛhaspatis son Kaca to repair to Uśanas and conciliate him and his daughter Devayānī and learn the Sañjīvinī. K. then repaired to the capital of Vṛṣaparvan the king of the Dānavas and promising to practise brahma carya for years he was accepted by Uśanas as his  pupil. Young as he was he by singing and dancing and playing on instruments etc soon gratified Devayānī. After years the Dānavas having discovered who he was slew him and one time hacked his body to pieces and gave it to wolves and jackals another time they pounded it into paste and mixed it with the waters of the ocean but both times Devayānī prevailed upon Uśanas to restore K. to life by the Sañjīvinī summoning him and saying Come. Then slaying him for the third time they burned the body and mixed the ashes with the wine  which Uśanas drank. As Devayānī again asked her father to revive K Uśanas said It is of no use as he is always killed again thou art always worshipped by the Bráhman the brahmans the gods including Indra the Vasus the Aśvins the enemies of the gods and the whole world therefore not grieve for a mortal. As Devayānī said she would starve Śukra imparted the Sañjīvinī to K who though reduced to powder remembered everything. K. then came out ripping open the stomach of Śukra and then revived Śukra by the Sañjīvinī. Uśanas declared that henceforth that brahman who would drink wine should be reckoned to have committed the sin of slaying a brahman. K. stayed with Śukra for years . When K. was about to return to the gods Devayānī asked him to become her husband and as he refused  she cursed him saying that his science should bear no fruit. K. again cursed Devayānī saying that no ṛṣis son should take her hand and that his science should bear fruit if not to himself at least to him to whom he might impart it. Then he went to the abode of Indra and the gods declared that he should become a sharer with them in sacrificial offerings . Cf. Aṅgirasaḥ pautra Āṅgirasa Bṛhaspatisuta.

That religion was accepted by the gods with their preceptors and priests and by Ā  R S M A Bhṛgu Atri Aṅgiras Si the Kāśyapas Vasiṣṭha etc.  all of them lived in obedience to Brahmán. But the foremost of the Dānavas Hiraṇyakaśipu etc and many other Daityas and Dānavas filled with wrath and covetousness took delight in all kinds of wicked acts etc wielding only the rod of chastisement those foremost of Asuras forsook every kindly intercourse with other creatures. Then Brahmán with the Brahmarṣis proceeded to a delightful summit of Himavat and after years he arranged a sacrifice. From the sacrificial fire arose Asi which Brahmán gave to Rudra  in order to enable him to put n irreligion. Rudra  with the sword destroyed and dispersed the Asuras  some of them penetrated into the bowels of the earth others got under the cover of the mountains some went upwards others entered the depths of the sea. Rudra then gave the sword to Viṣṇu Viṣṇu to Marīci Marīci to the maharṣis the maharṣis to Vāsava Mahendra  to the lokapālas the lokapālas to Manu  the son of Sūrya. He gave it to his son Kṣupa. Thence it passed successively to Ikṣvāku etc from Droṇa to Kṛpa from Kṛpa to thee  and thy brothers. Kṛttikāḥ is the nakṣatra of the sword Agni its deity Rohiṇī its gotra Rudra its high preceptor. Its eight mysterious names are Asi etc. . Of all weapons the sword is the foremost the Purāṇas truly declare that it was first wielded by Maheśvara . Pṛthu   created the first bow. Persons skilled in weapons should always worship the sword. Blessing to the reader .

Nala,son of,Vīrasena,. One day when the Pāṇḍavas were grieving for Arjuna Bhīma asked Yudhiṣṭhira to permit him to go and slay Duryodhana interpreting the time to be complete but he did not prevail upon Yudhiṣṭhira. While they were conversing the great ṛṣi Bṛhadaśva came before them and asked by Yudhiṣṭhira if there was on earth a king more unfortunate than himself he said that he would narrate a history of a prince more miserable than Yudhiṣṭhira viz. Nala who defeated deceitfully by Puṣkara dwelt in the woods with his spouse having neither slaves nor chariots nor brothers nor friends with him . Bṛhadaśva said The Niṣadha king Nala the son of Vīrasena was above all kings etc and fond of dice.  The Vidarbha king Bhīma was granted by the Brahmarṣi Damana a daughter Damayantī and three excellent sons Dama Dānta and Damana. Both Nala and Damayantī had not their equals in beauty and continually hearing of each others virtues they conceived attachment to each other though they had never seen each other. Once Nala in his garden saw a number of golden winged swans and caught one of them but let it loose as it promised to speak well of him before Damayantī. The swans having arrived at the Vidarbha country the one who had been caught by Nala led Damayantī to a secluded spot and fulfilled its mission. Damayantī caused it to speak to Nala of her . As Damayantī became sick of love her father invited all the kings to her svayaṃvara. At this time the ṛṣis of the gods Nārada and Parvata having arrived in course of their wanderings at the regions of Indra told him that the kings did not now come to him because they were intent on the svayaṃvara of Damayantī. Hearing this the Lokapālas set out on their vehicles for the svayaṃvara but seeing Nala on the way and filled with astonishment at his beauty they left their chariots in the sky and asked Nala to be their messenger . Nala promised to so but when Indra told him to go to Damayantī and tell her that Indra Agni Varuṇa and Yama desired her to choose one of them for her lord he asked them to spare him as he had come with the same object but as they insisted that he should stand by his promise he by their power entered without being perceived by the guardians into the apartments of Damayantī and saying his name fulfilled his mission . Damayantī declared that if she did not become the wife of Nala himself she would resort to poison or fire or water or the rope. Nala advised her to choose one of the gods maintaining that having come in a different mission he dared not seek his own interest. Damayantī then told him to come to her svayaṃvara in company with the gods then she would choose him at which no blame would be his and Nala returned to the Lokapālas and told them what had happened . At the sacred hour of the holy lunar day of the auspicious season Bhīma summoned the kings to the svayaṃvara and that assembly of kings resembled the Bhogavatī swarming with Nāgas. Damayantī beholding five persons all alike in appearance and recollecting the marks of the celestials of which she had heard from old people was unable to distinguish which of them was Nala. Filled with grief she then decided upon seeking the protection of the gods themselves and prevailed upon them that they assumed their true shapes. Thereupon she beheld the gods unmoistened with perspiration with unwinking eyes and unfading garlands not stained with dust and staying without touching the ground while Nala was revealed by his sha his fading garlands and by his being stained with dust and sweat and resting on the ground with winking eyes. She then chose Nala seizing the hem of his garment and placing a floral wreath round his neck. Nala promised Damayantī that he would remain hers as long as he lived and she spoke words of like import to him. The Lokapālas bestowed each a couple of boons on Nala Indra that he should be able to behold his divine nature in sacrifices and blessed regions thereafter  Agni his own presence wherever he wished and regions as bright as himself Yama subtle taste in food and pre eminence in virtue Varuṇa water wherever he desired and garlands of celestial fragrance.  Then the gods went to heaven and the kings returned home. Nala after the wedding stayed there for a time returned home ruled righteously and celebrated the horse sacrifice etc. He begat the son Indrasena and the daughter Indrasenā upon Damayantī . When the Lokapālas were returning they met Dvāpara with Kali going to the svayaṃvara and Indra told Kali that Damayantī had already chosen Nala. As Kali threatened to avenge himself he was rebuked by the Lokapālas as Nala had studied the four Vedas with the Ākhyāna as the fifth etc. When the gods had gone to heaven Kali said that he would take possession of Nala and deprive him of his king and asked Dvāpara to enter the dice . Kali then went to the country of the Niṣadhas and always watched for an opportunity. At last in the twelfth year when Nala after answering a call of nature touching water had said his twilight prayers without having washed his feet Kali entered his person. Then Kali becoming Vṛṣa   prevailed upon Puṣkara that he challenged Nala to a match of dice in order to acquire his king. Nala and Puṣkara gambled together for many months Nala being always worsted no one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading him from the play at last they came in a body which was told by the sūta to Damayantī who in vain represented it to Nala he uttered not a word in reply . Seeing that Nala had lost everything Damayantī told her nurse and maidservant Bṛhatsenā to summon the councillors in the name of Nala and tell them what had been lost the councillors approached Nala and Damayantī informed him that the citizens had come again in a body but he regarded her not. She then caused Bṛhatsenā to summon the sūta Vārṣṇeya who at her request yoked Nalas favourite horses and brought her two children to Kuṇḍina . There he left the children the chariot and the horses and went to Ayodhyā where he entered the service of king Ṛtuparṇa  as a charioteer . At last when Puṣkara had won all Nalas wealth and his king he proposed to him to stake Damayantī. But Nala feeling as if his heart would burst and gazing at Puṣkara in anguish without speaking a word took all the ornaments off his body and attired in a single piece of cloth left the city accompanied by Damayantī. They stayed for three nights in the outskirts of the city living on water alone. Nobody showed him hospitable regards as Puṣkara had proclaimed through the city that he that should show any attention to Nala would be put to death. After many days Nala saw some birds of golden hue and covered them with his cloth in order to catch them but they rose up to the sky taking away that garment of his and then told him they were the dice that had come hither to take away even his cloth. Nala proposed to Damayantī to leave him pointing out to her the roads to Avantī Ṛkṣavat Vindhya Payoṣnī Vidarbha Kośala and the south. But she would not leave him but suggested that they should go to Vidarbha . Nala refused to appear before Bhīma in his state of misery. They went on attired in the same piece of cloth. Once when Damayantī had fallen into a profound slumber in a shed for travellers Nala influenced by Kali resolved upon deserting Damayantī as separated from him  she might perchance wander to her relatives. With a sword that he found near the shed he cut off one half of the cloth and throwing the instrument away departed having first returned again and again dragged away by Kali but drawn back by love . When Damayantī awoke she lamented and cursed the being through whose imprecation Nala suffered woe saying that it should lead a still more miserable life. Thereupon wandering on she was seized by a gigantic serpent and rescued by a hunter as the hunter after comforting her tried to force her to love him he was cursed by her and fell n lifeless upon the ground . Description of the forest Damayantīs lamentations. She went in a northerly direction for three days and nights then she came to an asylum of ascetics who told her that she should again become happy together with Nala. Then the asylum disappeared. Sometime after wards having proceeded a long way she met with a body of merchants landing on the banks of a river its leader was Śuci and it was bound for the city of the Cedi king Subāhu . Damayantī followed the caravan. Once at midnight the caravan was destroyed by wild elephants and many men were trodden to death which some ascribed to their not having worshipped Maṇibhadra or Vaiśvavaṇa the kings of Yakṣas others to their having received Damayantī whom they thought to be a Rākṣasa or Piśāca or Yakṣa woman and resolved upon killing her when they saw her. Hearing this Damayantī fled. The next day the remnant of the caravan left the place. Damayantī with the brahmans that had survived the slaughter of the caravan came towards evening to the city of the Cedi king Subāhu. The boys began to follow her when she came before the palace of the king the queen mother let the nurse take her in. Damayantī agreed to stay there on the conditions that she should not eat remnants not wash anyones feet nor speak with other men but be protected against all aspirations. The queen gave her as a sairindhrī to her daughter Sunandā . Nala having deserted Damayantī saw a conflagration in the forest and therefrom heard a voice calling him by name and saw the Nāga Karkoṭaka who unable to stir told him that he had deceived the great ṛṣi Nārada and been cursed by him with the words Stay thou here immobile until Nala takes thee hence then thou shalt be freed from my curse and asked him to deliver him and promised to instruct him in respect of his welfare. The snake then became as small as a thumb and Nala taking him up went to a spot free from fire. Karkoṭaka let him proceed yet counting his steps and bit him at the tenth step  . Then the form of Nala was changed in order that people might not recognize him and Karkoṭaka assumed his own form and said that Kali dwelling in Nala should be tortured by his venom and that Nala should have no fear from animals with fangs from enemies and from men versed in the Veda and told him to go to Ayodhyā and present himself as a sūta Bāhuka before Ṛtuparṇa who would give Nala his skill in dice  in exchange for Nalas knowledge of horses and when he had become an adept at dice he should have prosperity and meet with his wife and children and regain his king. The Nāga king then gave Nala two pieces of celestial cloth saying that when he desired to get back his own form he should remember him and wear  this garment. Then he disappeared . On the tenth day Nala entered the city of Ṛtuparṇa he approached the king and named himself Bāhuka and said that he surpassed everybody in managing steeds and might be consulted in matters of difficulty  and affairs of skill and that he was versed in the art of cooking. Then he was appointed superintendent of Ṛtuparṇas horses on a pay of and Vārṣṇeya and Jīvala should be under his direction. Every evening he recited the śloka Where lies that helpless one  afflicted with hunger and thirst and worn with toil or upon whom s she now wait  Once Jīvala asked him who she was and Nala related to him the main features of his story without naming her or himself . Bhīma sent out brahmans in all directions to search for Nala and Damayantī promising kine etc to him that should find them. At length the brahman Sudeva the friend of Damayantīs brother recognized Damayantī in the city of the Cedis seated with Sunandā during the time of the kings prayers and told her who he was and that her relatives and children were well. Beholding Damayantī weeping and conversing in private with Sudeva Sunandā caused her mother to question Sudeva . Sudeva told the story of Damayantī and that he had recognized her by a mole between her eyebrows which was now almost covered with dust as her whole body. Then Sunandā washed away the dust and the queen mother recognized her by the mole as the daughter of her sister as she and Damayantīs mother were both daughters of the Daśārṇa king Sudāman and she herself had been bestowed on Vīrabāhu and her sister on Bhīma she had witnessed Damayantīs birth in the palace of her father in the Daśārṇa country. At her own request Damayantī was brought in a litter carried by men and protected by a large escort to the city of Bhīma and was received with respect and worshipped the gods and brahmans. Bhīma gave unto Sudeva kine etc. The next day Damayantī let her mother cause Bhīma to send brahmans out in all directions to seek for Nala. Damayantī ordered them everywhere to recite the ślokas O beloved gambler where hast thou gone cutting off half of my garment etc but to take care that no one knew that it was on her command . After a long time the brahman Parṇāda told that he had in Ayodhyā visited Bhāṅgāsuri and that Bāhuka had been affected by hearing his śloka and had said to him Chaste women though overtaken by calamity yet protect themselves etc. Damayantī then thanked Parṇāda and promised him great wealth and consulted with her mother and without Bhīmas knowing it sent Sudeva who told Ṛtuparṇa that to morrow Damayantī would hold another svayaṃvara . When ordered by Ṛtuparṇa to conduct him to the svayaṃvara of Damayantī Bāhuka felt his heart bursting with grief but promised to go there in a single day he yoked four horses born in Sindhu made Vārṣṇeya sit on the chariot and set out with so great speed that Vārṣṇeya thought he must be Mātali or Śālihotra who had taken a human shape or Nala . As the chariot was coursing thus Ṛtuparṇa lost his upper garment and Nala declared that it was impossible to recover it as they had already travelled one yojana thence. As Ṛtuparṇa rightly indicated the number of fruits of  a vibhītaka tree and said he was skilled in dice as in numbers Nala prevailed upon him to teach him the science and in future receive instead his science of horses. Then Kali came out from the body of Nala vomiting the poison of Karkoṭaka and assumed his own shape as the fire of Damayantīs curse had left him but remained invisible to others except Nala. Kali prevailed upon Nala that he should not curse him promising that those men who would attentively recite his history should be free from fear of him and entered the vibhītaka tree till Nala had gone far away. Then Kali returned to his abode. From the touch of Kali the vibhītaka tree from that hour fell into disrepute. Nala now became free from calamity though he did not assume his original form . At night they arrived at Kuṇḍina having passed yojanas. The steeds of Nala that were in that city and peacocks and elephants and Damayantī recognized the sound of Nalas chariot Damayantī ascended the terrace with the desire of seeing Nala. The Kośala king  wondered as he did not hear any talk of the svayaṃvara etc and Bhīma thought that he had come simply to pay his respects. When Ṛtuparṇa had gone to his appointed quarters with Vārṣṇeya and Bāhuka having tended the horses was sitting at the side of the chariot Damayantī sent a female messenger in search of Nala . The female messenger Keśinī asked Bāhuka about Vārṣṇeya and himself he said that Vārṣṇeya was the charioteer of Nala that nobody knew Nala except Nala himself and his wife as he did not discover his marks of identity anywhere and that he himself was the charioteer and cook of king Ṛtuparṇa at last she repeated the śloka of Parṇāda O beloved gambler etc and said that Damayantī wished again to hear the reply he had given Parṇāda then Bāhuka weeping said Chaste women though overtaken by calamity etc and Keśinī went to Damayantī and acquainted her with everything . Damayantī again sent Keśinī to stay in silence at Bāhukas side and mark his conduct she related that low passages grew in height so that he might pass through them easily that when he approached narrow holes opened wide that only by his looking upon them the vessels became filled with water that when he held a handful of grass in the sun the fire blazed up all of a sudden that he touched fire and was not hurt that water falling at his will flowed in a stream and that flowers pressed with his hands became gayer and more fragrant than before. Damayantī then caused Keśinī without Bāhukas knowledge to bring her some meat that had been boiled and dressed by him from the kitchen and recognized the taste. She then sent her two children with Keśinī. Bāhuka embraced them crying aloud saying they were like his own children and sent Keśinī away lest people might think evil . Having obtained the consent both of her father and mother Damayantī caused Nala to be brought to her apartments it came to an explication Damayantī declared that she had feigned to hold a second svayaṃvara because no one except Nala could in one day manage yojanas with horses and swore by the Air Sun and Moon who had been her protector for these three years and Vāyu bore witness to the truth of her words. Then a floral shower fell there and the celestial kettledrum began to play. Nala then wore the garment he had received from the serpent king and regained his  old form. Thus Nala in the fourth year was reunited with his wife . The next day they presented themselves before Bhīma. The citizens were in great joy and aned  the temples etc. Ṛtuparṇa asked Nalas forgiveness and Nala also asked Ṛtuparṇas forgiveness and made over to him his horse lore having obtained from him the mystery of dice. Then Ṛtuparṇa went away to his own city employing another person as his charioteer . Having dwelt for a month at Kuṇḍina Nala set out for the Niṣadha country with a single white chariot sixteen elephants fifty horses and infantry and proposed to Puṣkara that they should gamble again as Nala had won great wealth the stake should be Damayantī wealth and king and their lives if not he proposed a single combat. Puṣkara hoping to win Damayantī whom he loved gladly consented to gamble and lost at a single throw. Nala declaring that it was Kali who had e it all forgave his brother and granted him his portion and after a month let him go to his own town. All the citizens and subjects rejoiced at Nalas return . Then Nala with a large force brought Damayantī and his children home and passed his days in joy and performed numerous sacrifices with abundant gifts to brahmans. So thou also O Yudhiṣṭhira wilt blaze forth in effulgence soon. They that will repeatedly recite this history of Nala and they that will hear it recited will never be touched by adversity. As Yudhiṣṭhira feared that some one skilled in dice might summon him Bṛhadaśva taught him the science of dice  and then went to Aśvaśiras for a bathe. Yudhiṣṭhira then learnt from brahmans and ascetics from various directions that Arjuna was still engaged in ascetic penances and Yudhiṣṭhira grieved for him .
Nārada,son of,Dakṣa,b . Bhīṣma said  heard it from my father that in the Kṛta age during the epoch of Manu Svāyambhuva the eternal Nārāyaṇa the Soul of the universe took birth as the son of Dharma in a quadruple form as Nara Nārāyaṇa Hari and the Self existent  Kṛṣṇa. Amongst them all Nārāyaṇa and Nara practised the several austerities repairing to the Himālayan hermitage Badarī and riding in their golden chariot . Nārada dropped n on Gandhamādana from a summit of Meru and wandered over all the world and at last repaired to Badarī at the hour of Naras and Nārāyaṇas performing their daily rites. He said to himself this is truly the  abode of that Being in whom are established all the worlds including  As G K and M. U. in this spot Kṛṣṇa and Hari dwelt formerly what is that deity whom these two worship who are these Pitṛs whom these two Pitṛs of all beings ae Ṛ. Nārada bowing unto Mahādeva praised Nārāyaṇa and asked what god or Pitṛ he was sacrificing to. Nārāyaṇa said that about this topic nothing should be said as it was an ancient mystery but because of his devotion he instructed him about Kṣetrajña etc. The twenty one Prajāpatis Brahmán etc.  were first born and obeyed the eternal law of the Supreme God . Nārada  proceeded to Śvetadvīpa  to behold Nārāyaṇa in his original shape by yoga he soared into the firmament rested for a short while on a summit of Meru then he directed his eyes towards the north west and north of the milky ocean he saw the large island Śvetadvīpa more than yojanas from Meru the inhabitants of that realm have no senses etc.  they are white and free from every sin etc. Yudhiṣṭhira asked for further information about this people. Bhīṣma related the story of Uparicara the essence of all narratives which he had heard from his father . Arrived at Śvetadvīpa Nārada stood in yoga and hymned Nārāyaṇa   . Nārāyaṇa showed himself to Nārada bearing all forms uttering with his mouths Gāyatrī oṃ and the Āraṇyaka and the four Vedas he mentioned Ekata Dvita and Trita and instructed Nārada . Vāsudeva = Soul = Jīva = Śeṣa = Saṅkarṣaṇa  = Kṣetrajña  Sanatkumāra = Mind = Pradyumna  the Creator = Aniruddha = Īśāna = Īśvara = Ahaṅkāra.  am known as Puruṣa without acts am the th. Hiraṇyagarbha etc are in me. Nārāyaṇas boons to Brahmán in days of yore.  am Kapila etc. . Brahmán springs from Aniruddhas navel. The feats that Nārāyaṇa will perform   in the Tretā age shall take birth as Rāma of Bhṛgus race... in the twilight  between Tretā and Dvāpara shall take birth as Rāma Dāśarathi at that time Ekata and Dvita  will have to take birth as apes all those apes shall become my allies... in the period  joining the Dvāpara and the Kali shall take birth in Mathurā in order to slay Kaṃsa and take up my residence in Kuśasthalī  Dvārakā shall transplant Prāgjyotiṣa to Dvārakā and subjugate Maheśvara and Mahāsena who will help Dā. Bāṇa ...Brahmán himself never obtained a sight of me in this shape of mine which thou hast seen to day. Hari then disappeared Nārada returned to Badarī to behold Nara and Nārāyaṇa. This great Upaniṣad consistent with the four Vedas and with Sāṅkhya Yoga and called Pāñcarātra and recited by Nārāyaṇa himself was repeated by Nārada in the abode of Brahmán. Yudhiṣṭhira asked Was not Brahmán acquainted with this wonderful narrative of the glory of Nārāyaṇa  Bhīṣma said that it was only to Ṛ. in the abode of Brahmán that Nārada recited his narrative. The propagation of the narrative Ṛ.  Sūrya Ṛ. in Sūryas train etc . on Meru  Asita  the Pitṛs  heard it from my father Śāntanu it is a Purāṇa and should not be communicated to anyone that is not  a worshipper of Vāsudeva it is really the essence of the hundreds of other narratives thou hast heard from me in days of yore . and As uniting together churned the ocean for the amṛta after the same manner the brahmans in days of yore uniting together churned all the scriptures and raised this narrative. He who reads this becomes an inhabitant of Śvetadvīpa etc. Vaiśampāyana said Yudhiṣṭhira and all his brothers became devoted to Nārāyaṇa Vyāsa visited  the ocean of milk and worshipping the great God there he came back to his own hermitage. Bhīṣma said  have now repeated the narrative that was recited to Nārada that narrative has descended from person to person from very ancient times heard it from my father. Sūta said  have now told you all that Vaiśampāyana recited to Janamejaya. King Janamejaya properly discharged all his duties according to the scriptures. You have all undergone severe penances etc. residing in this sacred Naimiṣa forest ye are...conversant with the Vedas ...ye have come to this sacrifice of Śaunaka ye all ae ...Nārāyaṇa. heard this excellent narrative that has descended from generation to generation from my father in former times . Śaunaka asked about pravṛtti and nivṛtti etc. Sauti recited the discourse of Vaiśampāyana to Janamejaya. Janamejaya said that the whole world with Brahmán As and men are deeply attached to acts Brahmán etc have ated the religion of pravṛtti. Vaiśampāyana said that this question related to a deep mystery and that it required penances and acquaintance with the Purāṇas he recited what M. ṛ. Vyāsa said to his disciples Sumantu etc on Meru  Nārāyaṇa had been gratified by his penances on the shore of the ocean of milk and he had with the eye of knowledge beheld all that occurred in the beginning of the Kalpa Mahā Puruṣa or Paramātmā   Avyakta   Aniruddha   Pitāmaha  from Ahaṅkāra have sprung the five elements  Marīci etc are the eight Prakṛtis upon whom all the worlds depend Brahmán created them with the Vedas Vedāṅgas etc. Rudra   ten Rudras these eleven Rudras = Vikārapuruṣāḥ...Brahmán with the R Prakṛtis and . ṛ. repaired to the northern shore of the ocean of milk and practised the penances named mahāniyama  for celestial years  then Hari spoke to them saying that he would invest them with pravṛtti. They performed a sacrifice in honour of Viṣṇu according to the ordinances laid n for the Kṛta age. The great god was pleased and said that their pravṛtti should be fraught with ends whence there will be return Marīci etc the seven Ṛ. who are mānasāḥ  will become the preceptors of the Vedas wedded to the religion of pravṛtti and created for procreating offspring ...Sana etc these seven Ṛ. who are spiritual  sons of Brahmán and whose knowledge comes to them of itself are wedded to the religion of nivṛtti conversant with Yoga and Sāṅkhya and cause the religion of nivṛtti to flow in the worlds. Kṣetrajña is myself...Brahmáns son Rudra has sprung from his brow at his command...In the Kṛta yuga living creatures  should not be slain in the sacrifices in the Tretā yuga animals dedicated with mantras will be slain in the sacrifices then comes the mixed  yuga Dvāpara then Tiṣya with Kali in the van. Vyāsa continued . and Ṛ. went away. Only Brahmán remained desirous of beholding the great god then residing in the form of Amruddha the god then showed himself to Brahmán with a vast equine head etc saying that at times he would appear in incarnate forms. Then he disappeared and Brahmán proceeded to his own region. Do you bow to him who is the lord of the Rudras etc. . Blessing upon the reader . Janamejaya inquired of the meaning of the different names of Nārāyaṇa Vaiśampāyana related what Keśava  had said to Phālguna when the latter asked him about the signification of his names mentioned by M. ṛ. in the Vedas and the Purāṇas. Kṛṣṇa said In the Ṛgveda etc many are the names that have been mentioned by M. ṛ. from Nārāyaṇas  grace has arisen Brahmán and from his wrath has arisen Rudra description of Rudra   aed in days of yore the ancient Rudra for obtaining the boon of a son Brahmán etc ae Hari Nārāyaṇa . Etymology of Nārāyaṇa etc.  Ṛ Trita the eldest  son of Brahmán when thrown into a well by Ekata and Dvita invoked me as Pṛśnigarbha and was rescued from the pit Dīrghatamas  invoked me as Keśava became cured of his blindness and then came to be called Gotama  Agni and Soma blending together became transfused in one and the same substance .. in the Purāṇa this is said and further that the gods have Agni for their mouth . Asked by Arjuna about the unity of nature of Agni and Soma Kṛṣṇa related this ancient story  When only the infinite water  exists Bráhman  Puruṣa  Brahmán who caused Agni  and Soma  to spring from his own eyes  Agni is the hotṛ and the brahmán of the sacrifice he who offers food in the mouth of a brahman is said to pour libations into the sacred fire for gratifying the deities  in this way brahmans have come to be regarded as Agni. Agni is again Viṣṇu .  By Gautamas curse Indra got a green beard through the curse of Kauśika Indra lost his testicles and got those of a ram.  As Indra with uplifted thunderbolt would prevent the Aśvins from receiving a share in sacrifice Cyavana paralysed his arms.  Incensed at the destruction of his sacrifice Dakṣa by his austerities caused a third eye to appear on the forehead of Rudra.  When Rudra would destroy Tripura Uśanas tore a matted lock from his head and hurled it at Rudra whence serpents began to bite Rudra whose throat became blue just as in the Svāyambhuva Manvantara when Nārāyaṇa seized Rudra by the throat.  When Aṅgiras Bṛhaspati sat  to make preparation for the churning in order to raise the amṛta and touched water the water was not clear  he became angry and  the ocean saying From this day thou shalt be tainted with fishes etc.  Viśvarūpa Triśiras Tvāṣṭra was the purohita of the gods he was the sister son of the Asuras while publicly offering to the deities he secretly offered shares to the Asuras the Asuras with  Hiraṇyakaśipu at their head prevailed upon him through his mother that he  should aid Hiraṇyakaśipu who was cursed by Hairaṇyagarbha Vasiṣṭha saying Since thou hast chosen another hotṛ thy sacrifice shall not be completed and thou shalt be slain by a hitherto unknown kind of being. Viśvarūpa performed austere tapas Indra sent Apsarases of whom Viśvarūpa became enamoured and he promised to destroy Indra and the gods he uttered mantras by which he grew with one mouth he drank all the soma that was offered to the gods by the brahmans in all the worlds with one  food with one  the gods including Indra. These repaired to Brahmán and according to his counsel they prevailed upon Ṛ. Bhārgava Dadhīca that he should aban his body by his yoga power his bones Dhātṛ shaped into a thunderbolt which was pervaded by the energy of Viṣṇu with this vajra Indra struck Viśvarūpa and severed the heads from the body. By the pressing  of his limbs Vṛtra came into existence whom Indra slew. Terrified with the ble brahmanicide Indra abaned the sovereignty of the gods he entered a cool lotus stalk in the Mānasa lake and becoming very minute  by his yoga power  he entered the fibres of that lotus stalk. Now rajas and tamas assailed the deities the mantras of M. ṛ. lost their efficacy Rā. appeared the Vedas  were about to disappear  without an Indra the worlds lost their strength and became easy to overwhelm. Then the gods and Ṛṣis crowned Āyus son Nahuṣa as king of the gods. Nahuṣa ruled over heaven with luminaries on his forehead which had the virtue of robbing the energy of every creature. Then follows somewhat abbreviated the contents of  = foll.  In days of yore when M. ṛ. Bharadvāja was saying his prayers  on the shore of the celestial Gaṅgā he was approached by Viṣṇu who was taking his three strides Viṣṇu struck with water by Bharadvāja on the breast received a mark  on his breast.  Cursed by M. ṛ. Bhṛgu Agni was obliged to become a devourer of all things.  Aditi cooked food for the gods to strengthen them so that they might slay the Asuras there Budha after completing a vow came and asked for alms of Aditi but she intending that only the gods should eat it first gave him no alms. At this Budha  cursed Aditi saying that she would have a pain  in her womb in the second birth  of Vivasvat the egg of  mother Aditi  killed   Vivasvat Śrāddhadeva  Mārttaṇḍa.  Dakṣa had sixty daughters of whom he gave thirteen to Kaśyapa ten to Dharma ten to Manu and twenty seven  to Soma although the latter were all alike in respect of beauty etc yet Soma became more attached to Rohiṇī and was cursed by Dakṣa etc cf.  = Prabhāsa in the western ocean was originally called Hiraṇyasaras from this curse also have come the dark spots in the disc of the moon exhibiting the mark of a hare.  M. ṛ. Sthūlaśiras practised austerities on the north eastern side of Meru a breeze charged with all delicious perfumes gratifled him the trees around him  put forth their flowers to make a display he cursed them saying that they should not have flowers at all times.  Nārāyaṇa in days of yore for the good of the world became M. ṛ. Vaḍavāmukha  practising austerities on Meru he summoned the ocean but it did not come he then with the heat of his body evaporated its water and caused it to become as saltish in taste as the human sweat it should cease to be drinkable only to Vaḍavāmukha it should be sweet when he drinks it therefore to this day the water from the ocean is drunk only by Vaḍavāmukha who lives within it .  Umā the daughter of the mountain Himavat was desired in marriage by Rudra M. ṛ. Bhṛgu was refused and therefore he brought about that Himavat ceased to abound with jewels and gems. Even such is the glory of the brahman.  Etymologies of Hṛṣīkeśa etc.  Ṛ. Yāska having aed me by the name of Śipiviṣṭa succeeded in restoring  the Nirukta which had disappeared into the nether regions . Other identifications with Nāvāyaṇa  Ṛ. Pāñcāla etc aided by Nārāyaṇa etymology of Dharmaja etc. . Asked by Arjuna about that battle between Rudra and Nārāyaṇa Kṛṣṇa related All the universe became suddenly filled with anxiety etc.  peace was brought about by Brahmán the mark made by Rudras lance on Nārāyaṇas cheek should assume the form of a beautiful whirl and Rudra should be called Śrīkaṇṭha from the mark of Nārāyaṇas hand on his throat. The two Ṛ. Nara and Nārāyaṇa then made friends with Rudra and dismissing the gods once more set themselves to penances. In this way O son of Kuntī assuming diverse forms rove at will through the earth Brahmaloka and the high and eternal region of felicity called Goloka. That being whom at the time of all thy battles thou beheldest stalking in thy van is no other than Rudra... those foes whom thou hast slain were all in the first instance slain by him . Śaunaka asked why Nārada having seen the Supreme Lord in the form of Aniruddha again proceeded so quickly to Nara and Nārāyaṇa. Sauti said At an interval in his snake sacrifice Janamejaya addressed his great grandfather Vyāsa asking him this same question etc. . Vaiśampāyana answered Leaving Śvetadvīpa Nārada quickly proceeded to Meru full of wonder thence to Gandhamādana and traversing the sky to Badarī where he saw the Ṛ engaged in penances both with Śrīvatsa and matted locks both with the swans foot on their palms etc each of them with four muṣkas sixty teeth and four arms etc and told them what he had seen at Śvetadvīpa and that the marks of Nara and Nārāyaṇa were the same that he had seen on the Supreme Soul that realm where he resides the Sun warms not etc. having constructed an altar measuring eight fingers breadth he is practising penances there standing on one foot etc. whatever libations...are poured on the sacrificial fire by Ṛ etc all reach the feet of that great deity . Discourse of Nara and Nārāyana to Nārada about Nārāyaṇa Sūrya is said to be the r  entering Sūrya their bodies are consumed by his fire they then become invisible... reduced to invisible atoms they then enter into Nārāyaṇa   Aniruddha   Pradyumna  Saṅkarṣaṇa    Kṣetrajña  divested of sattva rajas and tamas... thou wert beheld  by us in Śvetadvīpa. . ṛ. Nārada became entirely devoted to Nārāyaṇa and dwelt in Badarī for celestial years . Vaiśampāyana related the discourse between Nara and Nārāyaṇa on one side and Nārada on the other about the rites in honour of the Pitṛs. Nārada the son of Dakṣa was originally the son of Brahmán created before all others by a fiat of his will. On one occasion the deities taught their children  the śrutis and having lost their knowledge had to acquire it again from those sons  the gods and the Pitṛs placing three piṇḍas on some blades of kuśa grass worshipped each other. Then Nārada asked why the Pitṛs in days of yore acquired the name of piṇḍas. Nara and Nārāyaṇa said The earth in days of yore disappeared and was raised up by Govinda  in the shape of a gigantic boar when the hour came for his morning prayers he suddenly shaking off three balls of mud from his tusk placed them upon the earth and dedicated them to his own self saying that he was resolved to create those that were to be called Pitṛs seeing that the three balls of mud had fallen towards the south he declared that these should be known henceforth by the name of Pitṛs. Having then offered those piṇḍas on the Vārāha mountain worshipping his own self he disappeared. Therefore those who sacrifice to the Pitṛs etc sacrifice etc to Viṣṇu himself . Vaiśampāyana continued . ṛ. Nārada after years repaired to his own retreat on Himavat while Nara and Nārāyaṇa remained in Badarī engaged in austerities the ancestors of that person who hates Nārāyaṇa sink into hell for ever glorification of Nārāyaṇa citing Vyāsa and referring to Harigītā  Vyāsa is Nārāyaṇa on earth who else could compile such a treatise as the Mahābhārata  Having listened to the diverse kinds of duties and resolved upon a horse sacrifice let thy great sacrifice go on. Sauti continued Formerly Nārada had recited the discourse about Nārāyaṇa to my preceptor in the hearing of many Ṛ. and the Pāṇḍavas and Kṛṣṇa and Bhīṣma. Sautis eulogium on Nārāyaṇa  . Śaunaka said  have heard from thee the glory of the Supreme Soul etc.  the form of Viṣṇu with the equine head that appeared in the great ocean on the north east was beheld by Brahmán Parameṣṭhin. Śaunaka then inquired why Hari had appeared in the form of Aniruddha with the horse head to Brahmán. Sauti said he would recite that which Vaiśampāyana recited to Janamejaya who put the same question to Vaiśampāyana. Janamejaya put the question to Vaiśampāyana. Vaiśampāyana expounded how the destruction is brought about of all things then from the primeval darkness  arises Bráhman  Puruṣa = Aniruddha = Pradhāna  = Avyakta = Viśvaksena Hari who yielding to yoga sleep lays himself n on the waters thinking of the creation  Ahaṅkāra = Brahmán etc. = Hiraṇyagarbha who takes birth within the lotus  from Aniruddha. Ating the attribute of sattva Brahmán commenced to create the universe. In the primeval lotus two drops of water had been deposited by Nārāyaṇa one like honey  which became Madhu made up of tamas the other hard  which became Kaiṭabha made up of rajas these two Asuras armed with maces beheld within the lotus Brahmán creating the four Vedas seized them and dived to Rasā in the north eastern ocean. Brahmán  complained before Īśāna  then he hymned Hari  my first birth from thee was due to a fiat of thy will my second birth in days of yore was from thy eyes my third birth was from thy speech my fourth birth was from thy ears my fifth birth was from thy nose my sixth birth was from an egg this is my seventh birth in this lotus. Puruṣa rose from his slumber and assumed an equine head he who was the abode of the Vedas the firmament became the crown of his head etc.  then he disappeared and proceeded to Rasā there he set himself to yoga and ating a voice according to the śikṣā he began to loudly utter Vedic mantras. The two Asuras making an appointment with the Vedas as to the time of their return threw them n to Rasātala and ran after the sound. Meanwhile Hari took up all the Vedas and gave them to Brahmán he placed the horse head in the north eastern ocean moreover the abode  of the Vedas and thence he was called  Aśvaśivas . Returning to the lotus Madhu and Kaiṭabha saw him in the form of Aniruddha in yoga sleep on the water white endued with stainless sattva on the hood of a snake surrounded with a garland of flames. They awakened him and were slain by him thence he came to be called Madhusūdana. Aided then by Hari and assisted by the Vedas Brahmán created all the worlds. Then Hari disappeared. Once more however he assumed the same form for the sake of the religion of pravṛtti . The brahman who frequently  hears or mentally recites  this story will never forget his  lore. Having aed with austere penances the god with the equine head Ṛ. Pañcala  acquired  Krama proceeding along the path pointed out by the deity . Hari is the receptacle  of the Vedas and of penances and yoga etc.  ṛta etc has Nārāyaṇa for its soul the Supreme Being is the cause of all this as Puruṣa and as Pradhāna he is the agent etc. the thoughts of all including Brahmán etc are known to Keśava but none of these can know what his thoughts are etc. he is called Vāsudeva because of his being the abode of all creatures he is the eternal highest M. ṛ etc. only the M. ṛ. that have knowledge for their souls behold the eternal Puruṣa who transcends all attributes  . Janamejaya said that the ekāntins  at once attain to the fourth or highest end  without going through the three and this end is better than that attained to by brahmans studying the Vedas with the Upaniṣads etc and by Yatis and he asked who first promulgated the religion of Devotion. Vaiśampāyana said When the Pāṇḍava and the Kuru armies were drawn up in array for the battle and Arjuna became cheerless Kṛṣṇa himself explained this religion . Having created this religion in the Kṛta age it is borne by Nārāyaṇa himself. Nārada was questioned about it by Arjuna in the midst of Ṛ. and in the presence of Kṛṣṇa and Bhīṣma. My preceptor Vyāsa heard what . ṛ. Nārada said and imparted it to me.  In that Kalpa when Brahmán took his birth in  the mind of Nārāyaṇa  and issued from the latters mouth Nārāyaṇa himself performed the rites of this religion. From him it passed to Ṛ. Phenapaḥ    Vaikhānasāḥ  Soma then it disappeared.  A the eyes of Nārāyaṇa  Soma  Brahmán  Rudra  Ṛ. Vālakhilyāḥ  then it once more disappeared through the illusive power of that god .  A the speech of Nārāyaṇa  Nārāyaṇa  Ṛ. Suparṇa   Vāyu  Ṛ. Vighasāśinaḥ the ocean  it once more disappeared and became merged  into Nārāyaṇa.  A the ear of Nārāyaṇa  Nārāyaṇa  Brahmán   Manu Svārociṣa  his son Śaṅkhapada  his son Suvarṇābha  when the Tretā yuga came it once more disappeared.  A the nose of Nārāyaṇa  Nārāyaṇa  Brahmán  Sanatkumāra  Prajāpati Vīraṇa   the muni Raibhya  his son Kukṣi  then it disappeared.  A an egg   Nārāyaṇa  Brahmán  Mu. Barhiṣads  Jyeṣṭha   king Avikalpana  then it disappeared.  A the lotus that sprang from the navel of Nārāyaṇa  Nārāyaṇa  Brahmán  Dakṣa  his eldest daughters son Āditya   Vivasvat  Manu   his son Ikṣvāku  the whole world when the universal destruction comes  it will once more return to Nārāyaṇa. The religion of the Yatis has been narrated to thee in the Harigītā. Nārada got it from Nārāyaṇa himself. Nārāyaṇa is aed  as of one form or of two or three  or four . Janamejaya asked why all persons not follow the religion of Devotion. Vaiśampāyana pointed to Sattva rajas and tamas. Hari casts a kind eye upon the person endued with sattva only Brahmán looks kindly upon him who is overwhelmed with rajas and tamas . and Ṛ. are given to sattva but  not in its subtle form. Asked by Janamejaya how one may attain to the Supreme Being and about pravṛtti Vaiśampāyana said that the Sāṅkhya Yoga the Veda and Āraṇyakas and the Pañcarātra are parts of one whole and even this is the religion of the Ekāntins the Sāttvika religion the Ekāntagati of the Yatis of Śvetadvīpa . Vyāsa imparted this religion to Yudhiṣṭhira . Janamejaya asked whether the Sāṅkhya Pañcarātra and Vedāraṇyaka are ekaniṣṭha  PCR. or pṛthaṅniṣṭha and about pravṛtti. M. ṛ. Vaiśampāyana said  bow to M. ṛ the sixth in the series beginning with Pitāmaha sprung from a portion of Nārāyaṇa the only son whom Nārāyaṇa in the first ages  created as his son the unborn and ancient the great receptacle of the Vedas. Janamejaya said When Vasiṣṭha  Śaktri  Parāśaṛa  Vyāsa how can Vyāsa be the son of Nārāyaṇa Vaiśampāyana said Vyāsa dwelt for some time on the Himavat he became tired of his penances owing to the great work of composing the Mahābhārata waited upon by his disciples Sumantu etc recapitulating  the Vedas etc.  asked by us Vyāsa related This narrative belonging to the early times has become known to me through my penances. In the seventh creation that from the lotus Brahmán being hesitating on account of the difficulty of creating Nārāyaṇa caused Intelligence  to enter Brahmán who now created Dai Dā G and Rā etc. seeing that many of these would afflict . and Ṛ Nārāyaṇa resolved upon incarnations and upon upholding the earth as a snake in Pātāla. Then uttering the syllable bho he from the voice  created Sārasvata Apāntaratamas whom he caused to distribute the Vedas in the antara of Manu Svāyambhuva saying that he should thus in each Manvantara and when Tiṣya  had set in he should become the father of the Kauravas etc and distribute the Vedas into diverse classes and be of a dark complexion born from M. ṛ. Parāśara in Vasiṣṭhas  line by a maiden he should know the past the present and the future not he but his son should be freed from passion  he should see Kṛṣṇa Sūryas son Śanaiśvara  will be a great Manu  during that Manvantara thou shalt be the foremost of the class beginning with Manu . Vyāsa said  am he that was born as Apāntaratamas underwent in days of yore the austerest penances. Vaiśampāyana said the preceptors  of the diverse systems  are  of Sāṅkhya the great Ṛ. Kapila  of Yoga  the primeval  Hiraṇyagarbha  of the Vedas Ṛ. Apāntaratamas by some called Prācīnagarbha  of Pāśupata Śiva   of Pañcarātra  Bhagavat and he may be seen in all the systems. The Sāṅkhya Yoga and Vedas are eternal those conversant with the Pañcarātra  enter Nārāyaṇa all acts spring from Ṛ. Nārāyaṇa . Janamejaya asked whether there are many Puruṣas or only one etc. Vaiśampāyana said that in the Sāṅkhya and Yoga many Puruṣas are spoken of but as the many Puruṣas have only one origin so the one Puruṣa is the universe  above the qualities citing the Vedas etc and the old narrative of the discourse between Brahmán and Tryambaka i.e. Brahma Rudra saṃvāda  .
Janamejaya,son of,Parikṣit,the third of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.  When Janamejaya the son of Parikṣit with his brothers Śrutasena Ugrasena and Bhīmasena was attending his long sacrifice at Kurukṣetra his brothers beat an offspring of Saramā. Saramā then cursed them saying that evil should come upon them unexpectedly. Janamejaya then returned to Hāstinapura and began to search for a purohita who might neutralize the curse one day when hunting he obtained for this purpose Somaśravas son of the ṛṣi Śruta śravas and a serpent Somaśravas would grant to any brahman whatever might be demanded of him. Janamejaya then conquered Takṣaśilā. About this time there was a ṛṣi named Āyoda Dhaumya with three disciples Upamanyu Āruṇi Pāñcālya and Veda. Upamanyu . Veda . Utaṅka  .
Ambarīṣa,son of,Nābhāga,. After the completion of the water rites by the Pāṇḍavas etc many Brahmarṣis etc came to Yudhiṣṭhira. Nārada congratulated Yudhiṣṭhira upon his success. Yudhiṣṭhira lamented the loss of his kinsmen  Yudhiṣthira at the match of dice had wondered seeing that Karṇas feet resembled the feet of Kuntī he inquired of Nārada why the earth had swallowed up the wheels of Karṇas chariot . Nārada recited to Yudhiṣṭhira the story of Kaṛnas pupilage with Droṇa and Rāma  and the curse called n upon him by a brahman whose cow Karṇa had inadvertently slain   then the story of Karṇas extraordinary powers of endurance in consequence of which his real caste became known to Rāma who there upon cursed him for his deceit the worm Alarka was an Asura named Daṃśa who in the Kṛta age had ravished the spouse of Bhṛgu and been cursed by him until he should be liberated by Paraśu Rāma. Karṇa arriving before Duryo dhana told him  have mastered every weapon . Nārada said To a self choice at Rājapura the capital of the Kāliṅga king Citrāṅgada Duryodhana Śiśupāla etc repaired the maiden  passed by Duryodhana who then  took her up on his chariot and abducted her by force. Karṇa riding on his chariot proceeded in Duryodhanas rear. The kings pursued Karṇa and Duryodhana but Karṇa made them all turn away and Duryodhana reached Hāstinapura with the maiden . Nārada said The Māgadha king Jarāsandha challenged Karṇa to a single combat at last they fought with bare arms and Karṇa was about to sever the two portions of Jarāsandhas body that had been united together by Jarā then Jarāsandha gave up all desire of hostility and gave unto Karṇa the town Mālinī . From that time he ruled over Campā and the Aṅgas agreeably to the wishes of Duryodhana. Allusions to etc.  . . ṛ. Nārada became silent Yudhiṣṭhira grieved Kuntī comforted Yudhiṣṭhira by telling him that neither she nor Sūrya could dissuade Karṇa from fighting the Pāṇḍavas . Yudhiṣṭhiras lament  before Arjuna he wished to renounce the sovereignty . Arjuna addressed Yudhiṣṭhira justifying war and approving of the acquisition of wealth quoting Nahuṣa and citing the conduct of the gods and Dā which is sanctioned by the Vedas this earth formerly belonged to king Dilīpa etc.  she now belongs to thee a great sacrifice awaits thee if thou t not perform this sacrifice the sins of this king shall all be thine those subjects whose king performs a horse sacrifice...all become pure as shown by the example of Mahādeva  this is the great path called Dāśaratha  . Unmoved by Arjunas words Yudhiṣṭhira desired to lead the life of a religious recluse . Bhīmas address to Yudhiṣṭhira commending sovereignty . Arjuna recited the story of the discourse between Śakra  and  certain youths  desirous of leading a forest life .

Draupadī reminded Yudhiṣṭhira of his former counsels  . Arjuna praised him who wields the rod of chastisement Indra by the slaughter of Vṛtra became the great Indra those among the gods that are given to slaughtering others are aed much more by men Rudra etc.  are all slaughterers all people bend to these gods but not to Brahmán or Dhātṛ or Pūṣan at any time except a few men of noble disposition . Bhīmas second address to Yudhiṣṭhira urging him to subdue his grief . Yudhiṣṭhira exposed the folly of earthly enjoyments quoting Janaka  my treasures are immense yet possess nothing if again the whole of Mithilā were burnt nothing of mine will be burnt . Arjuna recited the story of the discourse between the Videha king Janaka  and his queen in which the latter explained the claims of a life of poverty and renunciation . Yudhi ṣṭhiras reply to Arjuna on the vanity of wealth . Devasthāna pointed out to Yudhiṣṭhira that the period had not come when he could retire into the woods and recommended the assumption of sovereignty with his soul freed from attachment quoting a discourse which Bṛhaspati delivered to Indra the Ṛ etc at the religion of Exertion and attain to heaven through their acts . Arjuna justified before Yudhi ṣṭhira the slaughter of foes in battle Indra himself though a brahman became a kṣatriya in his acts and battled with his sinful kinsfolk times . Vyāsa dissuaded Yudhiṣṭhira from a life of retirement and commended a life of esticity quoting a verse of Bṛhaspati and reciting the story of R. ṛ. Sudyumna the brothers Śaṅkha and Likhita dwelled in two separate dwellings on the banks of Bāhudā once when Śaṅkha had gone out Likhita came to his asylum and ate many ripe fruits. Śaṅkha told him to confess to the king and ask him to inflict on him the punishment of a thief. King Sudyumna would par him but Likhita would not Sudyumna then caused his hands to be cut off Likhita having asked par of Śaṅkha was told by him to gratify  Ṛ and P. at Bāhudā upon which two hands grew out. Śaṅkha said that he was not his chastiser but the king has been himself purified as also thyself along with P. That king became eminent by this act and obtained the highest success . Vyāsa exhorted Yudhiṣṭhira to grant the wishes of his brothers perform sacrifices and imitate the great monarchs of old especially Hayagrīva  . Hearing the words of Vyāsa and seeing Arjuna angry Yudhiṣṭhira declared to Vyāsa that earthly rule could give him no delight. Vyāsa answered pointing out the virtues of Time quoting the old story recited by king Senajit in grief. Engaging in battle has been said to be the sacrifice for a king a due observance of the science of chastisement is his yoga and the gift of wealth in sacrifices in the shape of dakṣiṇā is his renunciation all this should be regarded as acts that sanctify him . Yudhiṣṭhiras reply to Arjuna recommending a life of yoga and austerities  this is the practice of R regarded by . as brahmans this is the opinion of the Vaikhānasas the Ajāḥ etc.  have all gone to heaven by means of Vedic study by performing the acts indicated in the Vedas battle sacrifices study of the Vedas restrainment of passion one goes to heaven by the southern path of the Sun the northern path is travelled by those devoted to yoga and is much applauded by those conversant with the Purāṇas one acquires heaven through contentment citing the discourse of Yayāti of old . Yudhiṣṭhira censured himself for his cupidity and for the slaughter he caused of his kinsmen  Bhīṣma had by the energy of his weapons burnt Ugrāyudha etc. Vyāsa comforted Yudhiṣṭhira by explaining the action of Destiny and exhorted him to work . Vyāsa recited the old story that is known by the name of Aśmans discourse the Videha king Janaka filled with sorrow questioned the wise brahman Aśman as to how a man should behave upon occasions of the accession and the destruction of both kinsmen and wealth. Aśman said that Destiny and Time are inevitable no person can see either heaven or hell the scriptures however are the eyes of the virtuous frame thy conduct according to the scriptures. Janaka became freed from grief enjoy the earth O son of Kuntī . Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa  to dispel Yudhiṣṭhiras grief. Kṛṣṇa asked Yudhi ṣṭhira not to grieve for men who died heroically in battle in the observance of kṣatriya duties quoting the Ṣoḍaśarājopā khyāna i.e. the old discourse of Nārada before Sṛñjaya when the latter was deeply afflicted with grief on account of the death of his son. Sṛñjaya was freed from grief and Nārada gave back to him his son Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin whom Parvata had given him and who had been bereft of life that child should live years . Requested by Yudhiṣṭhira Kṛṣṇa told Nārada Parvatopākhyāna  . Thereafter Nārada told Suvarṇasṭhīvi sambhavopākhyāna  . Vyāsa exhorted Yudhiṣṭhira to shake off his grief and assume the reins of sovereignty. Yudhiṣṭhira feared that the guilt of slaughter had stained him Vyāsa repeated his observations on Destiny  as Yudhiṣṭhira still was remorseful Vyāsa repeated his observations on Time and pointed to expiatory rites illustrating the case by the war of years by which the gods having slain Dai gained possession of heaven and slew brahmans called Śālāvṛkāḥ who had joined the Dā. thou hast only followed the path formerly trodden by the very gods men like you never go to hell. He recommended a horse sacrifice as an expiation mentioning that Indra assisted by the Maruts gradually performed sacrifices and became Śatakratu and is aed in the heavens by Aps Ṛ and . . Vyāsa discoursed on expiation and indicated the acts for which there should be expiation citing the sage Uddālaka who caused his son Śvetaketu to be begotten by disciple etc and declared that by penances religious rites and gifts one may wash off sins if one s not commit them anew and indicated diverse kinds of expiation for diverse kinds of sins . Asked by Yudhiṣṭhira Vyāsa declared what food is clean and what is unclean . Yudhiṣṭhira desired to hear of the duties of kings and of the four different orders. Vyāsa casting his eyes on Nārada directed Yudhiṣṭhira to apply to Bhīṣma for discourses on kingly duties as Bhīṣma having gratified . ṛ. with Bṛh at their head had acquired  a knowledge of the duties of kings and of that science with its interpretations that Uśanas and Bṛhaspati know and a knowledge of all the Vedas with their branches from Vasiṣṭha and Cyavana of Bhṛgus race in olden days he studied under Sanatkumāra  he learned the duties of the Yatis from Mārkaṇḍeya and obtained all weapons from Rāma and Indra although childless yet he has many regions of bliss before himself B. ṛ. were always his courtiers. Yudhiṣṭhira was ashamed to approach Bhīṣma. Kṛṣṇa exhorted Yudhiṣṭhira to rise up shaking off his grief . Thus addressed by Kṛṣṇa etc Yudhi ṣṭhira gave up his grief and anxiety and with his brothers and the other kings headed by Dhṛtarāṣṭra set out for Hāstinapura. The procession described  . The citizens welcomed Yudhiṣṭhira and Draupadī etc. . Yudhi ṣṭhira entered the palace with Dhaumya and Dhṛtarāṣṭra and was blessed by the brahmans but cursed by Cārvāka a Rā. who had disguised himself as a brahman and a friend of Duryodhana the brahmans killed Cārvāka by uttering the mere sound huṃ . Kṛṣṇa related In the Kṛta age Rā. Cārvāka performed penances in Badarī at last he solicited from Brahmán the boon of immunity from fear at the hands of every being in the universe which Brahmán granted him only with the limitation that he should be careful not to offend brahmans. Then he began to cause trouble to the gods Brahmán predicted Cārvākas friendship with Duryodhana and that he would insult the brahmans . The ceremony of Yudhiṣṭhiras installation on the throne described  he made gifts to the brahmans who all blessed him and his brothers . Yudhiṣṭhira answered and enjoined respect for his aged uncle disposed of the high appointments of state and caused the obsequial rites  to be performed in honour of the slaughtered heroes and performed acts of kindness to the ladies wied in the battle the destitute the blind and helpless . Then he aed Kṛṣṇa and assigned to his brothers proper residences from among the palaces of the Kuru princes slain in battle . They passed a happy night in their respective abodes and in the morning presented themselves before king Yudhiṣṭhira . Yudhiṣṭhiras gifts to diverse persons . Then he addressed Kṛṣṇa whom he found rapt in meditation  he uttered a hymn to Kṛṣṇa who awoke and praised Bhīṣma asking Yudhiṣṭhira to resort to Bhīṣma for instruction. Yudhiṣṭhira requested Kṛṣṇa to grant Bhīṣma the sight of his divine person. Kṛṣṇa caused Sātyaki to let Dāruka yoke his chariot with Sugrīva and Śaibya etc. . Descrip tion of the bed of arrows on which Bhīṣma lay surrounded by Ṛ. Vyāsa etc. . Bhīṣma hymned Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa moved by Bhīṣmas aations bestowed upon him heavenly knowledge compassing the Past the Present and the Future and went away. Those holy brahmans aed Bhīṣma and Kṛṣṇa. Seeing the devotion of Bhīṣma Kṛṣṇa suddenly rose from his seat and ascended his chariot with Sātyaki Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna mounted another Bhīmasena and the twins a third Kṛpa Yuyutsu and Sañjaya on their respective chariots . Then Kṛṣṇa etc proceeded to Kurukṣetra . Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Yudhiṣṭhira the five lakes of Rāma Bhārgava. Requested by Yudhiṣṭhira Kṛṣṇa related Rāmopākhyāna . Then he proceeded quietly in his chariot . Yudhiṣṭhiras eulogy of Rāma .  Beholding from a distance the spot on which Bhīṣma lay Yudhiṣṭhira etc descended from their chariots and approached and saluted the Ṛ. . Seeing Bhīṣma on the point of death Kṛṣṇa addressed him kindly and eulogized him  . Bhīṣma saluted Kṛṣṇa and beheld his eternal form. Kṛṣṇa said that it was owing to Bhīṣmas devotion that he had displayed his celestial form to him those regions O king are ready for thee whence there is no return fifty six days still remain for thee to live when Sūrya turns to his northerly course you shall go there . and  riding on their chariots are waiting for thee invisibly. Kṛṣṇa asked Bhīṣma to instruct Yudhiṣṭhira etc. when thou wilt leave this world for that all knowledge will expire with thee . Bhīṣma alleged physical weakness and mental darkness as reasons for his inability to obey Kṛṣṇa and he also hesitated to speak in Kṛṣṇas presence. Kṛṣṇa removed Bhīṣmas pain and granted him power to recollect everything and behold the universe like a fish in a limpid stream. M. ṛ. with Vyāsa aed Kṛṣṇa with words accompanied by Ṛc Yojus and Sāman verses celestial flowers fell and Aps. sang etc. At sunset the M. ṛ rising up saluted Kṛṣṇa Bhīṣma and Yudhiṣṭhira.

Yudhiṣṭhira humbly approached Bhīṣma and touched his feet Bhīṣma kissing his head asked him to take a seat and question him without anxiety .

Notwithstanding the entreaties of the king the jackal retired to the forest gave up his body by sitting in prāya and proceeded to heaven . A king should not behave after the manner disclosed in the history of a camel There was in the Kṛta age a huge camel who had recollection of all the acts of his former life he practised severe austerities in the forest Brahmán granted him the boon that he should have a neck so long that he could seize any food at even the end of yojanas. He became idle. One day a great storm arose.

Tanu said that a Ṛ. had been insulted by Bhūridyumna who asked by him for a golden jar and vegetable barks contemptuously had refused to gratify the ascetic who became disappointed . Tanu hung n his head in former days he had been disappointed by the king and he had practised penances for a long time and determined to drive away hope from his mind. He then discoursed about the slenderness of Hope. Then he caused  the lost prince to be brought thither rebuked the king and displayed himself to be the god of righteousness. Thus addressed by Ṛṣabha king Sumitra gave up his hope . Bhīṣma cited the old narrative of the discourse between Gautama and Yama. Gautama owned a wide retreat on the Pāripātra hills for years he underwent ascetic austerities there. One day Lp. Yama  came and spoke about truth etc. . How may a king in great danger and distress left by his friends behave .
Kauśika,son of,Kākṣīvat,.  Yudhiṣ ṭhira consulted his counsellors brothers ṛtvijes ministers Dhaumya Dvaipāyana etc as to the rājasūya . They all encouraged him to perform it. All people lived happily under his sway and loved him  Bhīma ruled over all men justly Arjuna protected the people from enemies Sahadeva administered justice impartially Nakula behaved towards everybody with humility. There was no extortion disease etc. Yudhiṣṭhira sent a messenger to Kṛṣṇa in Dvāravatī and Kṛṣṇa came to Indraprastha accompanied by Indrasena and was consulted by Yudhiṣṭhira . Kṛṣṇa said that Yudhiṣṭhira in order to become samrāj ought to slay the Magadha king Jarāsandha and deliver the princes whom Jarāsandha held shut up in a mountain hole in order to sacrifice them to Mahādeva . The now existing kṣatriyas are descended from the remnants of those who were exterminated by Rāma. They represent themselves to be the descendants of Aila and Ikṣvāku of those there are families. The Bhojas descendants of Yayāti are great and scattered all over the earth but now Jarāsandha ruling the middle land has overpowered them. His allies are  Śiśupāla who has become his senāpati  the Karūṣa king Vakra who fights by illusion   Haṃsa and Ḍimbhaka   Dantavakra Karūṣa Karabha Meghavāhana  Bhagadatta the Yavana king the ruler of the west who bears on his head the most wonderful gem on earth the old friend of thy father and who chastises Muru and Naraka he obeys Jarāsandha but in his heart he is tied by affection to thee  the king of Aṅga Vaṅga Puṇḍra and of the Kirātas Pauṇḍraka Vāsudeva who among the Cedis is called Puruṣottama and always bears from foolishness the distinctive signs of Kṛṣṇa  Bhīṣmaka king of the Bhojas the friend of Indra who governs a fourth part of the world who by his learning has conquered the Pāṇḍyas Krathas and Kaiśikas and whose brother Ākṛti is like to Rāma Jāmadagnya has placed himself under Jarāsandha though Kṛṣṇa etc his relatives are engaged every day in ng what is agreeable to him. Only Yudhiṣṭhiras maternal uncle the Kunti king Purujit who has his inions in the west and the south regards Yudhiṣṭhira with affection. The following peoples have fled for fear of Jarāsandha  the eighteen tribes of the northern Bhojas have fled towards the west  the Śūrasenas Bhadrakāras Bodhas Śālvas Paṭaccaras Susthalas Mukuṭṭas Kulindas and Kuntis  the Śālvāyana kings with their brethren and followers the southern Pāñcālas and the eastern Kośalas have all fled to the Kuntis  the Matsyas and the Sannyastapādas  have left their inions in the north and fled into the southern country  all the Pāñcālas have fled in all directions. Jarāsandhas relations to the Yādavas were the following Kaṃsa having persecuted the Yādavas married Asti and Prāpti daughters of Jarāsandha and sisters of Sahadeva and began also to oppress the old chiefs of the Bhojas who sought the help of Kṛṣṇa etc. Kṛṣṇa bestowed upon Akrūra the daughter of Āhuka and with Saṅkarṣaṇa  he slew Kaṃsa and Sunāman. Then Jarāsandha took up arms and the eighteen tribes differently Nīl. thought  they would be unable to check him even in years. His friends Haṃsa and Ḍimbhaka were incapable of being slain by weapons. Some other king named Haṃsa was slain by Rāma in the battle of the eighteen tribes  then Ḍimbhaka thinking that he could not live without Haṃsa killed himself in the Yamunā and Haṃsa hearing that also jumped into the Yamunā then Jarāsandha returned to his king and the Yādavas continued to live at Mathurā. But the wi of Kaṃsa the daughter of Jarāsandha urging him to revenge the death of her husband the Yādavas fled from Mathurā and took up their abode in Kuśasthalī aned by Raivata and strongly fortified the Gomanta mountains three yojanas in length. In the race of Kṛṣṇa there are brothers . Āhuka has sons. Cārudeṣṇa with his brother Cakradeva Sātyaki Kṛṣṇa Rauhiṇeya and Śāmba  are seven heroes  Kṛtavarman Anādhṛṣṭi Śamīka Samitiñjaya Kaṅka Śaṅku and Kunti are seven mahārathas then there are also two sons of Andhakabhoja and himself all these heroes remembering the middle country are now living among the Vṛṣṇis . Yudhiṣṭhira had some scruples which were opposed by Bhīma and Kṛṣṇa who cited from the Kṛta age five kings who had become emperors  Yauvanāśvi  by the remission of taxes Bhagīratha by protection Kārtavīrya by asceticism Bharata by strength and Marutta by prosperity families of kings have been unable to oppose Jarāsandha he has already brought eighty six kings to the house of Paśupati  when he has fourteen more he will offer them as sacrifices . Some further objections of Yudhiṣṭhira are refuted by Arjuna . The origin of Jarāsandha was the following The Magadha king Bṛhadratha who had three akṣauhiṇīs of troops married the two twin daughters of the king of Kāśi making an engagement never to show a preference for either. As he was childless he repaired to the ṛṣi Caṇḍa Kauśika the son of Kākṣīvat Gautama who was sitting under a mango tree. He gave a mango fruit to the king who gave it to his queens. They then brought forth each one half of a child which were thrown away but found and laid together by the rākṣasī Jarā became one living child . Jarā had been created by Svayambhū for the destruction of the Dānavas and named Gṛhadevī and always lived in the kings house and did him good because there was on the walls a likeness of her endued with youth and in the midst of children and she was daily worshipped with scents etc. The king ordered a great festival to be held in Magadha in honour of Jarā and named the boy Jarāsandha  . Some time after Caṇḍa Kauśika again came to Magadha and foretold the greatness of Jarāsandha that weapons should not hurt him and that he should see Rudra. After having installed Jarāsandha Bṛhadratha with his two wives retired to the woods and after practising ascetic penances ascended to heaven. When king Kaṃsa was slain by Vāsudeva Jarāsandha from Girivraja whirling a mace ninety nine times hurled it towards Mathurā where Kṛṣṇa was residing at that time the mace fell at Gadāvasāna near Mathurā at a distance of ninety nine yojanas . He with Haṃsa and Ḍimbhaka were more than a match for the three worlds therefore from policy the Kukuras Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis chose not to fight with him .

"[('Śiśupāla', 'Damaghoṣa')]",son of,"('Kṛtavarman', 'Hṛdika')",. . Kṛṣṇa related When Śiśupāla the son of Damaghoṣa had been slain his brother the Mārttikā vata king Śālva in order to avenge him came to Dvārakā in the Saubha who moved at will and slew many of the Vṛṣṇis and sought for Kṛṣṇa desiring to kill him. Kṛṣṇa was in Indraprastha at the rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira and when he learnt this on returning home he set out to slay him and found him in an island in the ocean and blowing his conch Pāñcajanya slew numerous Dānavas. Then as soon as he heard of the game at dice he had come to the Pāṇḍavas . . Copious description of the combats with Śālva When Śālva attacked Dvārakā it was well furnished and strongly fortified  and defended by Gada Śāmba etc. . Cārudeṣṇa Śāmba and Pradyumna  rushed out against him. They on both sides fought by means of māyā. Śāmba put Kṣemarṛddhi the commander of Śālvas troops to flight by a shower of arrows and slew a Daiteya named Vegavat with his mace. Cārudeṣṇa slew the Dānava Vivindhya with a consecrated arrow. Then Śālva riding on Saubha encountered Pradyumna . Riding on his chariot with a gaping makara in its standard Pradyumna with showers of arrows slew the Dānavas and pierced the heart of Śālva so that he fell in a swoon but he rose again and wounded Pradyumna about his throat so that he became senseless . Pradyumnas charioteer Dāruki a sūta carried him off the field by the help of his fleet steeds but when Pradyumna had regained his senses he ordered him to turn the chariot reminding him of the customs of the Vṛṣṇis in battle and saying that he had restrained Kṛtavarman the son of Hṛdika from sallying out as he would himself resist Śālva . As Śālva used his māyā of the Asuras Pradyumna shot him n with the Brahmāstra and was about to aim another arrow at him capable of killing any person when all the hosts of the gods with Indra and Dhaneśvara sent Nārada and Śvasana who ordered him to desist as the creator  had destined Kṛṣṇa the son of Devakī to slay him. Śālva then mounted Saubha and went away through the skies leaving Dvārakā . When Śālva had left Dvārakā Kṛṣṇa returned from the rājasūya and found Dvārakā deprived of its splenr etc.  He learnt from Hārdikya  about the invasion of Śālva committed the city to the charge of king Āhuka and Ānakadundubhi etc bowed to Bhava and set out on his chariot yoked with Śaibya and Sugrīva and with Dāruka for his charioteer blowing the Pāñcajanya till he arrived at Mārttikāvata and pursued Śālva who staying in Saubha remained in the sky above the midst of the ocean a krośa off so that Kṛṣṇas soldiers could not see it but were obliged to stand as mere spectators. After a long battle with arrows in which Kṛṣṇa killed numerous Dānavas they took to fight by means of illusion whirling maces ploughshares etc and then mountain peaks. As none could ascertain whether it was day or night or distinguish the points of the horizon Kṛṣṇa becoming bewildered made use of the Prajñāstra by which he regained light . Dāruka was covered all over with shafts. Then a messenger of Āhuka came from Dvārakā saying that Śālva had come to Dvārakā and had slain Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa thought that then Sātyaki Baladeva Pradyumna Cārudeṣṇa Śāmba etc must necessarily have been killed first. Now he saw Vasudeva falling from Saubha and swooned away but as he after regaining consciousness saw neither Saubha nor Śālva nor Vasudeva he concluded that it was illusion . Though Kṛṣṇa could not see Saubha which had vanished through illusion he discharged many arrows from the Śārṅga. The Dānavas set up a loud howl and when Kṛṣṇa making use of a weapon that pierced the foe following the sound killed them at one place the yell ceased at that place and started from another quarter. Then Saubha reappeared at Prāgjyotiṣa. Kṛṣṇa Dāruka and the horses were covered by torrents of rocks that concealed them and the Vṛṣṇis fled in all directions. Kṛṣṇa then destroyed the crags with Indras thunderbolt Dāruka pointed at Śālva and exhorted Kṛṣṇa to slay him. Kṛṣṇa made use of his Āgneya weapon and hurled his discus Sudarśana  against the city of Saubha that fell cut in twain like the city of Tripura by the shafts of Maheśvara. Then the discus came back into his hands and was hurled against Śālva and cut him in twain. The remaining Dānavas fled in fear. Kṛṣṇa returned to the Ānarttas. It was for this reason that he could not come to Hāstinapura and prevent the gambling. Then Kṛṣṇa took leave of Yudhiṣṭhira etc and set out for Dvārakā in his chariot yoked with Śaibya and Sugrīva taking with him Subhadrā and Abhimanyu. Then Dhṛṣṭadyumna set out for his own city taking with him the Draupadeyas. And the Cedi king Dhṛṣṭaketu set out for his beautiful city of Śuktimatī taking with him his sister . Also the Kaikeyas  went away. But the brahmans vaiśyas and inhabitants of the country would not leave the Pāṇḍavas. Yudhiṣṭhira in due time ordered his men to make the chariots ready .

Krauñca,son of,Himavat,. . Mārkanḍeya promised to tell the story of Kārttikeya the son of Adbhuta begotten of the wives of the Brahmarṣis. Formerly when the Asuras always defeated the gods Indra anxious to find out a leader for the celestial host repaired to the Mānasa mountain and hearing a woman crying for protection rescued her from the Asura Keśin whom he wounded and put to flight . She told Indra that she was Devasenā daughter of Prajāpati and that her sister Daityasenā had let herself be taken away by Keśin from the Mānasa mountain where they used to sport with their female friends with the permission of Prajāpati. Indra said that she was a sisters daughter of his mother Dākṣāyaṇī. She asked Indra to select a husband for her who was able to conquer the gods Dānavas Yakṣas Kinnaras Uragas Rakṣas and Daityas. Indra was grieved thinking there was no such husband for her. . Then Indra perceived the Sun rising from the Udaya hill and Soma  entering the Sun on the amāvasyā  at the Raudra muhūrta and the gods and Asuras fighting on the Udaya mountain the morning twilight tinged with red clouds the Sea blood red Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases offered oblations and Agni took the oblations and entered the Sun whilst the Sun was entering the twenty fourth parvan and Sindhu was flowing with a current of fresh blood etc. Indra thought that if now Soma or Agni gave birth to a son this son might become the husband of Devasenā. Then he repaired with Devasenā to the world of Brahmán who promised that it should be as Indra had thought. Then Indra. with Devasenā repaired to the place where the devarṣis Vasiṣṭha etc. lived and the gods also came thither to drink soma and receive their shares of offerings and the Adbhuta fire came from the solar disc to the āhavanīya and made over the offerings to the gods. He then saw the wives of the ṛṣis sleeping in their āśramas and fell in love. In order to look at them daily he entered the gārhapatya fire and dwelt there for a long time and at last from despair repaired to a forest in order to away with himself. Svāhā daughter of Dakṣa who had in vain loved Adbhuta now resolved upon assuming the guise of the wives of the seven ṛṣis . Svāhā first gratified  her desire in the guise of Śivā the wife of Aṅgiras and then lest somebody should unduly suspect the brāhmaṇa ladies she went out of the forest in the guise of a bird and on the Śveta mountain that was covered with clumps of reeds and guarded with seven headed poisonous serpents rākṣasas Piśācas etc she threw the semen which she held in her hand into a golden basin. Then assuming successively the form of five of the others she did the same on the first lunar day . Only the form of Arundhatī she was unable to assume because of her ascetic merit and devotion to her husband. The semen produced a child whom the ṛṣis called Skanda with six heads etc. On the second day it first assumed a form on the rd it looked like a little child on the fourth the limbs were developed. Seizing the bow used by the destroyer of Tripura Skanda uttered a terrible roar so that the great nāgas Citra and Airāvata sprang up. But Skanda seized them with two of his hands and holding a dart in one hand a cock in another etc and blowing a conch shell he terrified the creatures with his roars. The persons of various orders who then sought the protection of Skanda are called his followers by the brahmans . Discharging his arrows in the direction of the Śveta mountain he rent asunder the mountain Krauñca the son of Himavat therefore the swans and vultures go to the mountain Meru. The other mountains also screamed aloud. Then with his lance he rent in twain one of the peaks of the Śveta mountain. Mount Śveta and the other mountains left the Earth and fled the Earth was torn asunder on all sides she went to Skanda and regained her power the mountains bowed n to Skanda and came back to the Earth and all creatures worshipped Skanda on the fifth day of the lunar month . . Terrific prodigies were seen everywhere. The ṛṣis tried to restore tranquillity to the universe. The inhabitants of the Caitra ratha forest accused the wives of the six ṛṣis other ones the fowl  of being the cause thereof but nobody suspected Svāhā. The seven ṛṣis divorced their wives with the exception of Arundhatī though Svāhā claimed the child as hers. Viśvāmitra having concluded the sacrifice of the seven ṛṣis had secretly followed the god of fire and knew everything as it had happened. He sought the protection of Skanda and performed for him the thirteen auspicious rites of childhood  the jālakarman etc etc. Though Viśvāmitra informed the seven ṛṣis of the innocence of their wives yet they abaned them unconditionally. . The gods asked Indra to kill Skanda but he dared not attack him saying that Skanda was able to destroy even the Creator of the world. Then they let the Mothers of the world approach in order to kill Skanda but they ated him as their son and let him suck their breasts especially the daughter of Krodha with a spike in her hand and the daughter of the Red Sea who lived on blood and his father Agni came and transformed into Naigameya  with a goats month gratified him with toys .

Pūru,son of,Śarmiṣṭhā,Yayāti an ancient king son of Nahuṣa  bis   .  Having after years been attacked with decrepitude Y. asked his sons one by one to give him their youth and take upon them his decrepitude but only the youngest Puru yielded to his wish and taking upon himself the old age of Y. he ruled the king while Y as strong as a tiger enjoyed the company of his two wives and in the Caitra ratha wood of Viśvācī but without becoming satiated. He then recited some verses  and took back from his son his own decrepitude giving him back his youth. He then installed Pūru on the throne saying that he was his true heir and should continue the lineage which should be named after him. Y. then retired to Bhṛgutuṅga and having spent a long time in ascetism observing the vow of fasting he died and ascended to heaven with his wives .  Y. transferred his decrepitude to Pūru etc.  and cursed his other sons Yadu Turvasu Druhyu Anu  . Y. sported with Viśvācī in the Nandana wood and in Alakā and in the northern summit of Meru. Y. then recited some verses  and installed Pūru as king . The offspring of Yadu Turvasu Druhyu Anu and Pūru .  Having installed Pūru on the throne Y. entered the wood to lead the life of a hermit for years and then ascended to Svarga where he was reverenced by the gods the Sādhyas the Maruts and the Vasus wandering about in Devaloka and Brahmaloka. One day Indra asked him what he had said to Pūru when he bestowed the king upon him. Y. answered that he had said The whole country between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā is thine this is the central region of the earth the outlying regions will be the inions of thy brothers. Those without anger are ever superior to those under its sway etc. . As Y. said that he did not know his equal in ascetic austerities among men gods Gandharvas and maharṣis Indra declared that owing to this haughtiness he should fall from heaven yet he should fall among the virtuous. When falling he was beheld by the rājarṣi Aṣṭaka of whom he was the maternal grandfather Y. spoke disapprovingly of haughtiness etc and told that leaving earth he had obtained many high regions for years then he had dwelt in the town of Indra  for years then for years in the world of Prajāpati then in the abode of Devadeva  he had also dwelt in Nandana for ayutas of years assuming any form at will sporting with the Apsarases then there had come a messenger of the gods with a grim visage who thrice had shouted to him fall then he had fallen from Nandana hearing while falling the compassionate exclamations of the gods who had directed him to fall to the sacrificial place of Aṣṭaka and his companions . Y. continued Those who speak of their own merits after having dwelt for or years in heaven are med to suffer the pains of the hell called bhauma and are attacked by certain Rākṣasas with sharp teeth. Y. then taught the lore of transmigration and emancipation . Y. explained the duties of gṛhasthas bhikṣus brahmacārins and vānaprasthas and the different kinds of munis and mauna  . Y. then said  now shall fall into the bhauma hell the Lokapas of Brahmán hasten me thither. The kings Aṣṭaka Pratardana Vasu manas Auṣadaśvi and Śibi Auśīnara offered him their lokas and volunteered to go to hell  in his place Y. did not accept the offer. Then appeared five golden chariots in which they all five ascended to heaven Śibi leaving the others behind him. Y. told them that he was their maternal grandfather that he had given the whole earth with her horses etc to brahmans and that the earth and the firmament and fire existed owing to his truth           . c  Y. competed with Indra. On the place where he performed his sacrifice the ground is studded with places for the sacrificial fires of various forms and the earth seems subsiding under the pressure of Y.s pious works .  Mārkaṇḍeya continued Once when King Y. Nāhuṣa was sitting on his throne there came a brahman who asked him for wealth for his preceptor with whom he had made the appointment always to question the giver with what feelings he would give him what he asked for. Y. answered that he always felt happy when giving etc and gave him kine . As Y. was falling headlong towards the earth while the kings and Si. and Aps. laughed there came at the command of Indra a person whose business it was to hurl n those whose merits were exhausted and told him that his pride had caused his fall. Y. uttered the wish that he might fall among the righteous. He fell n among his daughters sons Pratardana Vasumanas Śibi and Aṣṭaka in the Naimiṣa wood where they performed a vājapeya sacrifice. They gave him their merits and the result of all their sacrifices. Mādhavī also came and gave him the moiety of hers likewise Gālava who gave him the eighth part of his . As soon as Y. was recognized by those virtuous persons he rose again to heaven without touching the surface of the earth and his four daughters sons in a loud voice repeated the gift of their merits  . Y. was honoured in heaven by G Aps . r R. ṛ and the gods. Brahmán explained to him that it was his vanity alone that had been able to destroy all his merit . Nārada continued Such was the distress into which Y. fell in consequence of vanity and Gālava owing to his obstinacy. Make peace with the sons of Pāṇḍu . b  Y the son of Nahuṣa was the sixth in descent from Soma. Y. had five sons Yadu the son of Devayānī and thus the grandson of Śukra Kāvya was the eldest while Pūru the son of Śarmiṣṭhā  was the youngest. Yadu  humiliated all the kṣatriyas. He did not obey the injunc tions of his father but insulted his father and brothers. He  established himself in the city named after the elephant . Y. cursed him and expelled him from the king. He also cursed his other sons who were obedient to Yadu and placed his youngest son Pūru on the throne .  Y the son of Nahuṣa performed rājasūya sacrifices he gave to the brahmans the whole of the wealth in the possession of Mlecchas etc. he sided with the gods against the Asuras having divided the earth into four parts he gave it away to four persons . His wives were Devayānī daughter of Uśanas and Śarmiṣṭhā he roved through the celestial woods at last he installed  Pūru on the throne and retired into the forest . e sung by Y. quoted. b . b . b sung by Y. quoted .   sung by Y. quoted  . b . b . b .

Mūka,son of,Danu,Kairātaparvan the rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr forming an episode to Arjunas journey to the abode of Indra . . It is anew related how Arjuna set out from the Kāmyaka wood towards the north he entered a terrible forest resorted to by Siddhas and Cāraṇas and then proceeded to the Himavat . For four months he practised austerities until the ṛṣis made representations about it to Śiva who dismissed them after having removed their fears . Then Śiva with his bow and arrows in the guise of a Kirāta accompanied by Umā in the guise of a Kirāta woman by merry spirits and thousands of women approached Arjuna as he was about to kill Mūka a son of Danu who in the form of a boar would have killed Arjuna. Arjuna and Śiva at the same time pierced Mūka with their arrows and killed him when dying he again assumed his rākṣasa form then they fought against each other first with arrows then with the very bows then with swords then with trees and stones then with the fists and then by clasping each other at last Arjuna lost his senses and was almost reduced to a ball of flesh when he regained consciousness he made a clay image of Śiva which he worshipped with a garland which then appeared on the head of the Kirāta he thus learned that it was Śiva and prostrated himself at his feet. Śiva declared that Arjunas prowess was equal to his own promised to give him his weapon and gave him eye so that he beheld him in his true form together with Umā. Arjuna then fell on his knees and worshipped him saying O Kapardin etc.  . Śiva said that Arjuna  was in a former life Nara etc. When granted a boon Arjuna asked Śiva to give him the Pāśupata weapon named Brahmaśiras . Having purified himself he was instructed in its use on the condition that he should not hurl it against a human being for then it would destroy the universe. The earth trembled etc. The gods and Dānavas beheld the weapon in its bodily shape standing by the side of Arjuna. When Arjuna had been touched by Śiva all that was evil in his body was dispelled.
